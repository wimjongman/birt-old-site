<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>
This report uses a (rather old) Microsoft Access database called "emp". To run
this report, you'll need to download and install this database:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="emp.zip">sample database zip file</a>.
<li>Unzip the database into a convenient location.
<li>Create a System DSN for this database using the Microsoft Access driver.
Call it "EmpExample".
</ul>

<h1>About the Report</h1>
<p>
The report has an outer query that displays  information about an employee. Then, it
has two "inner" queries that display details for this employee. Because we are showing
two sets of details, we need two "subreports", and we use a grid to list them
side-by-side.
<p>
The report prints for Employee 2. The queries are set up to all get data for the same
employee. (A later revision will take the employee ID as a parameter.)
