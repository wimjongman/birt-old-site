<p class="subhead">A Taste of what you can do with BIRT</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The example reports here show just a few of the things you can do with BIRT.
  Unless otherwise noted, the reports are meant to be run against the &quot;Classic Models Inc.&quot; sample database that is included in the BIRT download. </p>
<p>Preview a report by clicking on the title  link. To try a report for yourself, click on the rptdesign link to display the ROM file, save it to disk and then use File--&gt;Import to bring the file into your Eclipse workspace. If the report uses the Classic Models database, you should be able to run the report immediately. If the report uses another database, follow the instructions provided in the &quot;Other Notes&quot; section of its description. </p>
