<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>
This report uses a  Microsoft Access database called "Sample". To run
this report, you'll need to download and install this database:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="Sample.zip">sample database zip file</a>.
<li>Unzip the database into a convenient location.
<li>Create a System DSN for this database using the Microsoft Access driver.
Call it "BIRT Misc".
</ul>

<h1>About the Report</h1>
<p>
The report prints a bank statement for a single account. A report parameter ask 
for the account ID. The accounts in the sample data base are: 33892, 53205, 
76407 and 83927.<p>
The report parameter accepts the account number from the user. The query defines 
a data set parameter that passes the account number to the database. The List 
item &quot;binds&quot; the query parameter to the report parameter.<p>
A List element holds the account overview information including a logo and 
account summary. The account information comes from the first record in the 
query. (Another, perfectly fine, way to do this report would have been to use 
two queries. Have one that fetches the account summary information, another that 
gets the details for the account.)<p>
The account transactions are listed using a table element. The first column 
shows the record index using the row[0] syntax. (The 0th column of a data row is 
a 0-based record index.)<p>
The Deposit column shows positive transactions, the Withdrawal column shows 
negative transactions. Two computed columns in the data set create the deposit 
and withdrawal amounts from the single transaction amount field. The nice thing 
about doing these calculations in the data set is that you can test them in the 
designer even before you create the layout -- a handy way to ensure the business 
calculations are right before moving on to formatting.<p>
The Balance column is a running total. We should use the Total.runningSum( ) 
aggregate. However, when this example was written, that aggregate was not yet 
available, so the calculation instead uses a global JavaScript variable to 
compute the total. The balance column uses highlighting to show negative 
balances as red. (Account 33892 illustrates the resulting formatting.)<p>
The report makes extensive use of styles to centralize style information.</body></html>
