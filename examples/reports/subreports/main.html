<p class="head">BIRT Report Examples</p>
<p class="subhead">Using Sub Reports Within BIRT</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Sub reports are a very common type of reports. These are also referred to as Master Detail reports or Parent Child reports.
BIRT is a flexible tool in that it provides the report developer with the flexibility to design many reports and
integrate them in sub report fashion via a few clicks of the mouse.
This example demonstrates the use of BIRT to create reports that are linked together.
For example, a main customer listing report provides the customer ID as input to a sub 
report that displays details about each customer.  In this example, a customer purchase report list
the totals for all customer IDs.  A second report list customer details.  This example combines these two reports.
