      <p>The BIRT project addresses a wide range of reporting needs within a typical 
        Java application. Today, reporting capabilities in an application are 
        often implemented in an ad hoc fashion by the application developer, using 
        technology that is not ideally suited to the task, or through the development 
        of a one-off solution for that application. This is expensive and time-consuming, 
        and provides limited reporting capabilities for the end users of the application. 
        BIRT aims to address this problem by providing Eclipse-based open source 
        and extensible tools and frameworks that allow developers to easily incorporate 
        reporting functionality within their applications.</p>
      <p>We encourage active participation in the BIRT project - read on and get 
        involved through the <a href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.birt">BIRT

      The Eclipse Report Designer is an Eclipse-based desktop authoring environment 
      for report development. Eclipse Report Designer enables application and 
      report developers to create simple and complex reports for use within their 
      organization. The tool caters to the broad range of report development skills 
      from the non-programmer report developer focused on report layout to the 
      application developer looking for sophisticated control over report creation.

      The Web Based Report Designer project delivers a fully customizable and 
      extensible, 100% HTML based tool for creating reports with basic layouts 
      and data manipulation. The tool will leverage components such as style sheets 
      and templates created using the Eclipse Report Designer. In addition, the 
      tool will provide an Eclipse-based customization facility for the user interface 
      for full branding and embedding within Java applications. The goal of this 
      project is to provide an accessible and easy-to-use report design environment 
      to meet the needs for ad hoc report creation by business users within any 
      java application. </td>

      (ERE) <br>
      The Report Engine allows Java application developers to quickly integrate 
      powerful report generation and viewing capabilities into their applications 
      without having to build the infrastructure from lower level Java components. 
      The Report Engine project enables reports to be generated using the XML 
      report designs created by the Eclipse Report Designer, Web Based Report 
      Designer or any other tool. To support this, the Report Engine provides 
      two core services: generation and presentation. The generation service within 
      the Report Engine is responsible for connecting to the specified data source(s), 
      retrieving and processing the data (sorting, grouping, aggregations, etc), 
      creating the report layout and generating the report document. The presentation 
      service within the Report Engine provides a rich set of viewing capabilities 
      for report content. This includes the infrastructure for viewing a document 
      online; for printing a document; and for generating alternate output documents 
      such as PDF. </td>

      The Chart Engine project provides a rich business chart generation capability 
      that can be used as a standalone charting component, as well as providing 
      the chart generation service within the Report Engine project. Visual presentation 
      of business data in the form of charts is a common, and key, aspect of many 
      reports and other forms of business intelligence. As such, a robust charting 
      capability is essential within the overall Business Intelligence and Reporting 
      Tools project. </td>
