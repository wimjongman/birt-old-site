<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
BIRT is an open source, Eclipse-based reporting system that integrates
with your J2EE-based web application to produce compelling reports for both web
and PDF.
<p>
BIRT Release 1.0 provides core reporting features such as report layout,
data access and scripting. BIRT is currently in
the community review phase prior to the 1.0 Release. Please try BIRT and
tell us what you think by filling bugs reports &amp; enhancement requests
through Bugzilla as explained on the <a href="community.html">community</a>
page.
