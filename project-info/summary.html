BIRT 2.0 was released on 1/23/2006. 
The project team is shifting its focus to its 2.1 release, 
which is planned to be part of the Callisto simultaneous release expected for late June 2006.  

Project planning is still under way for BIRT 2.1 and 
this plan will be published next week and will be updated in the coming weeks to add new projects as they are identified. 
Currently, there are several projects already identified:
<ul>
<li>Integration with the rest of projects in the Eclipse Callisto Simultaneous Release.</li> 
<li>Improve distribution and installation of BIRT. </li>
<li>ICU4J Integration. </li>
</ul>
Please send your feedback and suggestions to BIRT's bugzilla.
The first BIRT 2.1 milestone will be designated M5 in order to synchronize with the Callisto milestone numbering, 
 targeted for March 3, 2006.
