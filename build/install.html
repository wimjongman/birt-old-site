<p class="head">Installing BIRT</p>
<p class="subhead">A step-by-step guide</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Below are complete instructions for installing BIRT. If you are already
familiar with Eclipse plugins, you might want to follow the abbreviated
requirements and instructions on the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads">
download page</a>.
Otherwise, follow along below for detailed steps for installing BIRT.

<h1>Java</h1>
<p>
You'll need a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> J2SE 1.4 JRE. The latest version, 
at the time of writing, is 1.4.2_07. Download
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">J2SE v 1.4.2_07 JRE</a>
and install it.

<h1>Eclipse</h1>
<p>
BIRT is compatible with Eclipse 3.0.1. BIRT will not run with Eclipse 2.x; and has
known problems with the Eclipse 3.1 milestone builds. BIRT has not been tested with
the Eclipse 3.0 release. Download and install the
<a href="/birt/frameizer.php?page=http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">
Eclipse Platform 3.0.1 Release</a>.
<p>
(Note: Eclipse, EMF, GEF and BIRT are all available from the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">Eclipse download page</a>.)
<p>
Eclipse comes as a zip file or tar file. On Windows, unzip the install file
into your "C:\Program Files" directory. This will create a subdirectory called eclipse.
<p>
To make it easier to start Eclipse, create a shortcut to Eclipse on your desktop:

<ul>
<li>From the desktop, right click, choose New&rarr;Shortcut.
<li>For location, enter "C:\Program Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe" (without quotes.)
<li>Click Next.
<li>Enter “Eclipse” for the shortcut name.
</ul>

<h1>GEF</h1>
<p>
GEF is the "Graphic Editor Framework", an Eclipse plugin used by the BIRT UI.
Download the
<a href="/birt/frameizer.php?page=http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/tools/gef/downloads/index.php">
GEF 3.0.1 Release, GEF Runtime</a>.
<p>
GEF comes as a zip file. Unzip GEF into directory that contains Eclipse. If you
installed Eclipse into the standard location on Windows, then unzip GEF into
"C:\Program Files".

<h1>EMF</h1>
<p>
The BIRT charting feature uses EMF, the Eclipse Modeling Framework. Download the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/scripts/downloads.php">
EMF & SDO RT version 2.0.1</a>. Look in the Latest Releases sections of the
download page.
<p>
EMF also comes as a zip file. Unzip EMF into directory that contains Eclipse.
This is the same directory you used for GEF.

<h1>BIRT</h1>
<p>
Download the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/">
Latest milestone or stable build</a> (whichever is newer). Download only the
BIRT designer: "birt-designer-XXX.zip".
<p>
BIRT is also a zip file. Unzip BIRT into the directory that contains Eclipse.

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note</span>:
For BIRT 1.0M1 <i>only</i>, unzip BIRT into the plugins directory:
eclipse/plugins. If you installed BIRT on Windows in the default location,
then put BIRT into "C:\program files\eclipse\plugins". Later builds use the
same zip location as GEF and EMF.</div>

<h1>Common Problems</h1>
<p>
If the BIRT perspective does not appear in Eclipse, some users suggest that
you do the following in Eclipse 3.0.1:

<ul>
<li>Shut down Eclipse
<li>Delete the configuration folder in the eclipse directory,
<li>Restart Eclipse and again check for the BIRT perspective.
</ul>
<p>
Note that this may lose some of your Eclipse settings; use this technique
carefully.
<p>
For Eclipse 3.1, the recommended practice is to start Eclipse with the -clean option:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
eclipse.exe -clean
</pre>
  
<h1>JDBC Driver</h1>
<p>
You will likely want to use your own JDBC driver with BIRT. Here's how. BIRT
includes the Open Data Access (ODA) framework for data access. To add a JDBC driver,
include the driver's jar file name in the JDBC ODA driver's configuration 
file: odaconfig.xml. The configuration file is in the plugin directory for
the JDBC ODA plugin: eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.
<p>
Use any text editor to edit the configuration file. You will find the following 
starting at line 26:

<pre class="code-block">
&lt;DriverLibraries>
 &lt;LibrariesForOS>
  &lt;OSType>All&lt;/OSType>
  &lt;LibraryName>oda-jdbc.jar&lt;/LibraryName>
  &lt;LibraryName>jtds-0.9.jar&lt;/LibraryName>
 &lt;/LibrariesForOS>
</pre>

Simply add another <code>&lt;LibraryName></code> element for each 
additional JDBC driver jar file that might be needed.
<br><br>
By default, a driver's library files must be in the JDBC plugin directory.
So, copy your jdbc driver jar into 
eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.
<br><br>
You can optionally add a <code>&lt;Location></code> element to specify the
location of the JDBC driver files.
</div>

<h1>Updating a BIRT Installation</h1>
<p>
If you have a version of BIRT installed, and want to install a newer version,
simply do the following:

<ul>
<li>Close Eclipse.
<li>Locate your Eclipse plugins directory. If you installed on Windows in the
default location, this is "C:\program files\eclipse\plugins".
<li>If you added any custom JDBC drivers, save a copy of these drivers, and
the modified odaconfig.xml file, from 
eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc to a temporary location.
<li>Delete all directories that start with "org.eclipse.birt".
<li>Download and install BIRT as described in the BIRT section above.
<li>Copy your custom JDBC drivers and and odaconfig.xml file from your temporary
location back into eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.
<li>Restart Eclipse.
</ul>
