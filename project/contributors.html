<h1>Initial Code Contribution</h1>

<p>During the six months prior to the creation of the Eclipse BIRT project, 
Actuate has been actively researching and developing capabilities that 
correspond to the initial BIRT projects. This has involved researching 
the requirements and needs for the XML Report Design, development of initial 
code, and investigating utilizing existing commercial code from other 
Actuate products. Actuate is seeding the BIRT project by donating the 
work from this research and development. Specifically:</p>

<dl class="bold-list">

<dt>XML Report Design Schema</dt>
<dd>A schema for representing the data access 
  and layout aspects of reports ranging from simple listing style reports 
  through complex, highly formatted reports.</dd>

<dt>Report Design Object Model Component</dt>
<dd>A component that encapsulates 
  the logic of resolving report element properties based on report object 
  hierarchy, style sheets and report scripting, as well as providing report 
  design read/write and persistency. A subset of the functionality with 
  unit test programs has been completed.</dd>

<dt>Report Execution and Rending Engine Component</dt>
<dd>A component that takes 
  a report design file as input and generates various report output format 
  such as HTML, PDF, and PostScript for printing. A subset of the functionality 
  with unit test program has been completed.</dd>

<dt>Report Designer</dt>
<dd>An Eclipse plug-in that helps users design report 
  layout through a user friendly GUI. A subset of the functionality with 
  unit test program has been completed.</dd>

</dl>
          
<p>Innovent and Actuate have 10 years of experience in the business intelligence 
market. The BIRT project will involve a significant number of experienced 
developers in this field and will work with the Eclipse community to build 
on this initial code to deliver capabilities to market as soon as possible.
    
<p>In addition to the Actuate research and development work, Actuate is working 
with other Eclipse members to leverage existing code in other areas.
