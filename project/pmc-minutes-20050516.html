<h1>Minutes </h1>

<h2>BIRT PMC Meetings</h2> 
<p>
Going forward, the BIRT PMC will be meeting every Monday at 10am Pacific.
Minutes will be distributed to the birt-dev@eclipse.org mailing list and posted 
on the BIRT project pages at www.eclipse.org/birt.

<h2>BIRT & Bugzilla </h2>
<p>
The BIRT project is currently using a mix of Eclipse Bugzilla and an internal bug 
tracking system. At the Release Review, the PMC agreed to move to an open bug 
tracking system that is visible to the community as soon as possible.
<p>
The PMC discussed the details here and agreed to use the Eclipse Bugzilla system. 
The plan is to start using Eclipse Bugzilla for all defects and enhancements as 
soon as BIRT 1.0 is released.
<p>
In the meantime, the project team continues to monitor bugzilla for community 
reported defects and enhancements. 

<h2>Eclipse Release Synchronization </h2>
<p>
The Eclipse Council meetings this week intend to discuss the pros and cons of 
synchronizing releases across Eclipse projects. The PMC had a discussion on 
impact/feasibility for BIRT:
<p>
For release schedule synchronization, the BIRT PMC would support a model where 
Eclipse projects ensured platform compatibility within 30-60 days from the 
platform release. However, it was noted that when there is simple downstream 
compatibility with the platform, this would be relatively easy. It gets much 
more complex when there are many inter-project compatibility dependencies.
<p>
For release number synchronization, the BIRT PMC is neutral on this one. If we 
did sync up numbers, our preference would be to do this after BIRT 2.0.
<p>
In both cases, the detailed discussions would be dependent on the conclusions 
and recommendations from the Council discussions.
