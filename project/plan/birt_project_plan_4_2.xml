   <p:introduction><html:div><html:p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next major feature release of the Eclipse BIRT project after 3.7, designated release 4.2 and code-named Juno. 
This release is occurring simultaneously with the 3.8 release. The 4.2 release release contains significant new feature work, 
while the 3.8 release focuses on stability and bug fixes.</html:p>

<html:p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire
Eclipse community, plans are posted in an embryonic form and then revised from time to time throughout the release cycle.</html:p>
<html:p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for any release, even if no features were to change.</html:p>
<html:p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the projects under the Eclipse BIRT project. Each plan item covers a feature or API that
is to be added, or some aspect that is to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary(usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item
is without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.</html:p><html:p>Please send comments about this draft plan to the <html:a href="mailto:birt-dev@eclipse.org">BIRT Developer</html:a> mailing list.</html:p></html:div></p:introduction>

 <p:target_environments>
     	<html:p>In order to remain current, each release of an Eclipse project targets reasonably current versions of underlying operating environments and
		other Eclipse projects on which it depends.</html:p>
		<html:p>Most of Eclipse, and all of BIRT, is "pure" Java code and has no direct dependence on the underlying operating system. For BIRT, the chief
		dependence is on the Eclipse Platform, Graphical Editor Framework (GEF), Modeling Framework (EMF), and on the Java 2 Platform that runs it. </html:p>
		<html:p>The Eclipse BIRT 4.2 release depends on the following compatibility stacks:</html:p>
		
		<html:p><html:b>BIRT 4.2 Reference Stack for Java SE 7</html:b></html:p>
		<html:ul>
  		<html:li>Java SE 7</html:li>
  		<html:li>Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary 3.7, 3.8, 4.2</html:li>
  		<html:li>Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) Runtime 3.7</html:li>
  		<html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) 2.7</html:li>
  		<html:li>Data Tools Platform Project 1.9 (DTP)</html:li>
  		<html:li>Web Tools Project (WTP) 3.3</html:li>
		</html:ul>

		<html:p><html:b>BIRT 4.2 Reference Stack for Java SE 6</html:b> </html:p>

		<html:ul>
  		<html:li>Java SE 6 </html:li>
  		<html:li>Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary 3.7, 3.8, 4.2 </html:li>
  		<html:li>Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) Runtime 3.7 </html:li>
  		<html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) 2.7 </html:li>
  		<html:li>Data Tools Platform Project (DTP) 1.9 </html:li>
  		<html:li>Web Tools Project (WTP) 3.3</html:li>
		</html:ul>
		

		<html:p>The Eclipse Platform and BIRT run in a variety of operating environments. Testing is focused on a handful of popular combinations
		of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these are our reference platforms. Eclipse BIRT undoubtedly runs fine in many
		operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered
		when running Eclipse BIRT on non-reference platforms that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with
		running Eclipse BIRT on a reference platform.</html:p>

		<html:p>For BIRT 4.2, the project team plans to tests and validate the following reference platforms:</html:p>

   <p:compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>		
       	<html:p>BIRT 4.2 will be compatible with earlier versions of BIRT to the greatest extent possible. The nature and scope of some of the key plan items for
		BIRT 4.2 are such that the only feasible solutions might break compatibility. In other regards, BIRT 4.2 will be compatible with 3.x, 2.x and 1.x. We also
		aim to minimize the effort required to port an existing plug-in to the 4.2 APIs.</html:p>
		<html:b>Compatibility of Release 4.2 with Prior Releases</html:b>

		<html:p>BIRT 4.2 will be compatible with prior releases of BIRT unless noted otherwise. The detailed compatibility statement is listed below.
		In this statement, "BIRT" refers to all BIRT components: BIRT Report Framework, BIRT Runtime, and BIRT Chart SDK.</html:p>
		<html:p><html:b>API Contract Compatibility:</html:b> BIRT 4.2 will be upwards contract-compatible with BIRT prior releases except in those areas noted in the 
<html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/BIRT_Migration_Guide">Eclipse BIRT Migration Guide</html:a>. Downward contract compatibility is not supported. In other words there is no guarantee that
		compliance with BIRT 4.2 APIs will ensure compliance with prior BIRT release APIs. 
Refer to general Eclipse document on <html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">Evolving
		APIs</html:a> for a discussion on the kinds of API changes that maintain contract compatibility.</html:p>

		<html:p><html:b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</html:b> The BIRT 4.2 plug-in framework will be upwards binary-compatible with prior BIRT release plug-ins except in those 
areas noted in the <html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/BIRT_Migration_Guide">Eclipse BIRT Migration Guide</html:a>. This means that plug-ins (including extension plug-ins) for prior 
BIRT releases will be upwards binary-compatible with BIRT 4.2 unless noted otherwise. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. In other words plug-ins for BIRT 4.2 will not be usable 
in prior BIRT releases. </html:p>

		<html:p><html:b>Source Compatibility:</html:b> BIRT 4.2 will be upwards source-compatible with prior BIRT releases except in those areas noted in the <html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/BIRT_Migration_Guide">Eclipse BIRT Migration Guide</html:a>. This means that source files written to use prior BIRT release APIs will successfully compile and run against BIRT 4.2 APIs. Downward
		source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new BIRT APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of BIRT.</html:p>

		<html:p><html:b>Report Design Compatibility:</html:b> BIRT 4.2 will be upwards report design compatible with prior BIRT releases except in those areas noted in the 
<html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/BIRT_Migration_Guide">Eclipse BIRT Migration Guide</html:a>. This means that reports created with prior BIRT releases can be successfully opened by BIRT 4.2 
and upgraded to a 4.2 format.</html:p>

		<html:p><html:b>Non-compliant usage of API's: </html:b> All non-API methods and classes, and certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are
		considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
		on anything other than what is specified in the BIRT API are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a
		single release much less with an earlier releases.</html:p>

         	<html:p>Continuing on the themes for previous releases of BIRT, the BIRT project's overriding release 4.2 theme remains extending the Eclipse platform to
			provide infrastructure and tools that allow application developers to design, deploy, generate and view reports within their applications. In this
			context,the BIRT project also adopts and supports key themes within the overall Eclipse planning process.</html:p>
         </html:div>
     </p:preamble>
     <p:theme name="Support Eclipse 4.2 as Primary Workbench">
        <p:description>
        	<html:div>Starting with Juno all Eclipse projects are required to use Eclipse 4.2 as their primary workbench, but also maintain and support an Eclipse 3.8 based
deliverable. This theme calls for supporting Eclipse 4.2 as the primary workbench, which means that BIRT 4.2 needs to be built and tested using
Eclipse 4.2. The theme also calls for supporting Eclipse 3.8, ideally by ensuring compatibility or alternatively by providing separate BIRT binaries.

     <p:theme name="Compare KPIs Across Relative Time Periods">
        <p:description>
        	<html:div>Being able to monitor and compare KPIs across relative time periods, for example number of units produced in the last 45 days or sales YTD versus Previous YTD, are 
common data visualization requirements.  This theme aims to enhance BIRT with the ability to easily address such requirements.

     <p:theme name="Maven Integration">
        <p:description>
        	<html:div>The feedback from the BIRT community indicates that there is solid demand to "mavenize" the BIRT project. This theme calls for providing support for the 
Maven build infrastructure since its popularity is growing fast among Java application developers.

     <p:theme name="Calculated Measures Efficiency Enhancements">
        <p:description>
        	<html:div>This theme aims to decrease the generation times for BIRT design containing crosstabs by providing a new, alternative approach to defining computed measures. 
With this new approach, just the computed measures included in the crosstab will be calculated at generation time, as opposed to calculating all measures part of the underlying 
BIRT cube powering the crosstab.

     <p:theme name="Option to Apply Filters After Computing the Totals">
        <p:description>
        	<html:div>This theme aims to give BIRT authors the option to specify that the filters in a BIRT design should be applied after the aggregations are computed 
as opposed to before - which is the default option. The new option will make it possible to create designs that display unfiltered totals along with filtered detailed data. 
For example a report that is filtered to display just the data for two countries: USA and Canada, but the totals for all countries, thus allowing for percentage of total analysis.
