      <p>The Eclipse Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Project will address 
        a broad range of needs in the business intelligence and reporting space 
        using the Eclipse platform. </p>
      <p>The business intelligence and reporting space is focused on tools and 
        capabilities that extract data from data sources, process that data, and 
        present the processed information to the end users. The information may 
        be needed to enable the users to perform their operational or analytical 
        job functions, or it may be customer-centric information such as a transaction 
        statement. The capabilities can range from application- and production-level 
        reporting, through ad hoc user-driven query tools, to highly interactive 
        multi-dimensional online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining 
        tools. While many business intelligence and reporting applications access 
        operational data sources, it is often the case that developers provide 
        specific data warehouses to support the business intelligence and reporting 
        needs of an application. The tools in this space can include facilities 
        to help build these data warehouses.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that a given application often needs a range of complementary 
        capabilities in this area to meet the needs of different users of the 
        application. For example, consider components of an online order processing 
        application: The individual order invoices will be printed for inclusion 
        in the shipping box and the shipping clerk will need an online or printed 
        shipping list (both production-level reports); while a product line manager 
        may want to perform ad hoc queries to see which products generate the 
        most returns; while the purchasing agent may use analytics to look for 
        trends and improve stocking levels. Providing a range of coordinated and 
        complementary capabilities under the Eclipse Business Intelligence and 
        Reporting Tools Project is intended to ensure that the developed technology 
        can effectively be used to meet this broad range of needs.</p>
      <p>Initially, the Project will focus on leveraging the Eclipse platform 
        to provide infrastructure and tools for the designing, deploying, generating 
        and viewing of reports in an organization, including ad hoc query and 
        reporting tools. While not an initial focus, the BIRT project scope includes 
        complementing these reporting capabilities with Online Analytical Processing 
        (OLAP) and Business Intelligence dashboard functionality. Over time, but 
        not in the initial scope, the creation of additional projects is anticipated 
        and encouraged to address additional aspects of business intelligence, 
        such as Executive Information Systems (EIS), statistical analysis, modeling 
        capabilities (what-if analysis), Data Mining Tools, Data Warehouse Modeling 
        Tools, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) tools and Data Quality Tools.</p>
      <p>The initial deliverable of the Eclipse Business Intelligence and Reporting 
        Tools Project is to provide a robust platform that can be used to quickly 
        and effectively create and deploy reports with any degree of complexity 
        without having the developer create the data access, processing and formatting 
        logic using Java code or components. In the majority of cases, the report 
        developer will design a report within the Eclipse framework using a 100% 
        visual design paradigm. However, in recognition of the fact that the variety 
        of report layouts and complexity of data access is infinite, the project 
        will also support extensive programmatic customization of the report generation 
        processes, including programmatic creation of report designs.</p>
      <p>Reports extract data from a data source or sources, perform manipulations 
        and calculations on the data to answer business questions, and present 
        the results as information in a formatted and convenient form for the 
        business user to use. This information is then typically used for operational 
        or decision support purposes within an organization. Reports vary dramatically 
        in size, content and complexity and will include or combine characteristics 
        such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listings of information (Example: Transactions in an account)</li>
        <li>Sorting, grouping and aggregation of data with and without subtotals 
          (Example: A listing of all product sales for each sales person, grouped 
          by state)</li>
        <li>Charts to present information in easy to understand formats (Example: 
          Pie chart showing an investor's portfolio allocation by High Growth/Growth/Income/etc. 
          categories)</li>
        <li>Matrix or cross-tab layouts (Example: Financial budget reports with 
          cost codes as rows, columns for each month, and cells containing numerical 
          data for that cost code/month)</li>
        <li>Delivery of information as one or a combination of web pages, PDF 
          files, printed documents, Excel files, etc. (Example: Frequent flyer 
          statement delivered as a web page online and a printed document in the 
          mail)</li>
        <li>Precise, highly formatted layouts (Examples: Bank statements; utility 
          bills; commission statements; invoices; government forms)</li>
        <li>Page navigation for long reports (Examples: Hundreds of pages corporate 
          cell phone usage bill with First Page, Next Page, Go to Page, etc. buttons)</li>
        <li>Table of Contents (Example: Multi-page Investment Portfolio summary 
          with Table of Contents to quickly navigate to Account Summary; Fund 
          History; etc.)</li>
        <li>Keyword or content search within a report (Example: find information 
          on a customer in a 1000 page customer account report)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This can be contrasted with data-driven JSP pages where the data manipulation 
        and presentation needs are more transaction driven and do not include 
        recurring reporting needs such as complex aggregation (performed outside 
        of the database) and highly complex layouts.</p>
      <p>For report development, the project broadly targets three classes of 
        developer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Application Developers</b> - These are Java developers who are 
          creating applications that include the need to retrieve data and present 
          that data in the form of reports. This is likely to be a subset of the 
          overall application and will include many of the characteristics discussed 
          above. In this case, the report generation and viewing will be embedded 
          in the overall application.</li>
        <li><b>Report Developers</b> - Report developers are not typically skilled 
          in writing Java code. They expect to use a visual desktop tool to create 
          any type of report - including defining database connections, report 
          content and report layout. These reports may then be deployed as part 
          of an application, or through an easy to use deployment framework.</li>
        <li><b>Business Users</b> - Business users often want to create their 
          own report layouts or customize existing reports. They work through 
          a very easy-to-use web-based report creation and editing facility to 
          answer business questions on an ad hoc basis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The project will address both the design time needs of report creation 
        as well as the run-time requirements of report generation and deployment. 
        A high-level architecture diagram is provided below. The project will 
        adopt and support accepted open standards wherever feasible.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse Business Intelligence and Reporting Project is divided into 
        a number of sub-projects that reflect the initial focus on the reporting 
        aspects of business intelligence and the high-level architecture of the 
        project. These are discussed in the sub-project section below. As discussed 
        above, the creation of additional sub-projects is anticipated and encouraged 
        to address additional aspects of business intelligence.</p>
      <p>Due to the wide variety of potential applications, it is recognized that 
        BIRT cannot meet all the requirements of all applications. It is therefore 
        a core design principle for the projects within BIRT to support a broad 
        range of extension points within the tools and frameworks that allow developers 
        to address additional needs. These extension points may be utilized for 
        adding value in commercial products using BIRT, or may be developed and 
        contributed into the Eclipse open source community.</p>
      <p>For example, logging tools can use BIRT's data extension point to plug-in 
        a data query user interface and access logic to read and process log files, 
        use BIRT's report engine to present the information in the log, and extend 
        BIRT's output/rendering adaptor to email or send a short message to a 
        user with the report output in a format targeted for that device.</p>
      <p>We expect the Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Project to produce 
        functional requirements that are more appropriately satisfied through 
        the Eclipse Project or other Eclipse foundational projects. In such cases, 
        the Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Project PMC will coordinate 
        the corresponding Project PMCs the design and implementation of the corresponding 
        contribution.</p>
