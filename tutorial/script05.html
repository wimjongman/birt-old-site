<p class="subhead">Building a Data Set</p>

<h1>Build a Data Set</h1>
<p>
Now we're ready to build and test our data set. This is a two-step process.
First, we build the bulk of an SQL query using a wizard, then we fine tune
it and test it using the data set editor.

Let's build the data set:

<ul>
<li>Find or open the Data Explorer view.
<li>Select the Data Sets node in the tree view.
<li>Right-click to open the context menu. (We'll just say "open the context menu"
or "choose x from the context menu" from now on.)
<li>Select New Data Set. The New Data Set dialog will appear.
<li>Enter "Customers" for the Data Set Name field.
<li>Ensure that the Data Source field shows the sfdata data source created above.
<li>Ensure that the Data Set Type field shows "JDBC select data set". This builds a
data set for an SQL SELECT query.
<li>Click Next.
</ul>

<h1>Choose Tables</h1>
<p>
The next page lets you select one or more tables for your query. For our first
report, we'll select just one table: Customers.

<ul>
<li>Choose "Tables" within the Select Type field.
<li>Type "%" (without the quotes) into the Apply Filter field.
<li>Click Apply Filter to find all tables.
<li>Select the customers table.
<li>Click the &gt; button to add it to the query.
<li>Click Next.
</ul>

<h1>Choose Columns</h1>
<p>
You can choose any number of columns to appear in your report. Normally, you would
choose only those columns that are actually needed by the report. For our first
report, we'll choose all columns.

<ul>
<li>Scroll the list of columns up so you can see the customers table entry.
<li>Select the customers table entry.
<li>Click the &gt; button to add all customer columns to your query.
<li>Click Finish.
</ul>
