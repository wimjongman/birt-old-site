<p class="head">BIRT Tutorial</p>
<p class="subhead">Getting Started</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This brief tutorial walks you through building a simple report with BIRT.
It introduces the major UI features, and many of the BIRT reporting elements.
At the completion of this tutorial, you should be able to start building your
own reports using your own database.
<p>
We'll create a simple customer listing report, with the customers grouped by
state and city. For each customer, we'll display a name and phone number.

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">1.0M3 Note</span>:
The instructions here have been updated for the latest 
stable build. If you are using an earlier build, some of steps will be quite 
different.

<h1>Install BIRT</h1>
<p>
If you have not yet done so, install Eclipse, GEF, EMF and BIRT. You'll find complete
instructions for doing so on the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/">BIRT Download</a> page.

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">1.0M3 Note</span>: This tutorial uses the new 
&quot;Classic Models&quot; sample database. This database uses Apache Derby as its DBMS. 
Note that a bug in M3 prevents Derby from working if you install Eclipse in a 
path that contains spaces. On Windows, this means you should install Eclipse in 
C:/eclipse instead of C:/Program Files/eclipse.<h1>Open BIRT</h1>
<p>
BIRT is a perspective within Eclipse. To open it, use the Window item on the
Eclipse main menu. Choose Open Perspective, then Report Design. If report Design 
does not appear directly in the Open Perspective window, then choose Other... A list of perspectives
will appear. Choose Report Design.
<p>
Eclipse will switch to display the BIRT perspective.

<h1>
Example Report</h1>
<p>
If you get stuck as you work through the tutorial, or if you want to see the 
finished report right away, simply download it:<ul>
  <li>Use your browser to download the report: <a href="customers.rptdesign">
  customers.rptdesign</a>.</li>
  <li>Save the file into an Eclipse project directory. (See the next page if you 
  don't yet have a project.)</li>
  <li>Your browser may store this as an XML file. If so, rename it back the the 
  name above.</li>
  <li>Within Eclipse, select your project in the Navigator view and choose 
  Refresh from the right-click context menu.</li>
  <li>Double-click the report to open it in the BIRT report designer.</li>
  </ul>
