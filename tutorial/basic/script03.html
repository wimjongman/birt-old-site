<h1>Brief UI Tour</h1>
<p>
Before we start work on the report, let's take a quick
tour of the UI. We'll be looking at most of the UI in detail as we build our 
report.

<h1>Cheat Sheets</h1>
<p>
Notice at the right of your Eclipse workspace (for the default configuration) is
a view called "Cheat Sheets." This view walks you though the process of building
a report based on the template you selected.<p>
For now, let's go ahead and close that window since we'll be following the
steps in this tutorial.

<h1>Layout Editor</h1>
<p>
The main area is the Layout Editor. This is the place where you create your
report design. The editor has three tabs:

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Layout
<dd>Where you edit your report design.

<dt>Preview
<dd>Runs your report and shows the output.

<dt>Code
<dd>Where you add code to your report using JavaScript.
</dl>

<h1>Views</h1>
<p>
Around the editor are a number of views:

<dl class="arrow-list"	>
<dt>Palette
<dd>Shows the standard <i>report items</i> you can add to your report
using drag &amp; drop.

<dt>Outline
<dd>Shows the structure of your report as a tree view.

<dt>Navigator
<dd>Standard Eclipse view that shows your projects, and the reports
within your projects.

<dt>Data Explorer
<dd>Shows your data sources (connections), data sets
(queries) and report parameters. You also use this view to add data set
columns to your report layout.

<dt>Property Editor
<dd>Displays properties for many report items. It has
tabs and groupings that organize properties into categories.

<dt>Properties View
<dd>Standard Eclipse view that shows all properties for
a report item as a simple list. This view is optional, and we'll not use it in
this tutorial.
</dl>

<h1>Displaying Views</h1>
<p>
You can arrange your views any way you like. You can also hide them by clicking
the "X" button next to the view tab. If you accidentally hide a view, you can
display it again by using the Window&rarr;Show View menu item.
<p>
Many people find that a convenient layout is to have the Palette, Navigator, Outline 
and Data Explorer docked at the left edge of your workspace, and the Property
Editor and Properties view docked at the bottom of the workspace.
