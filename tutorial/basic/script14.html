<h1>Wrap Up</h1>
<p>
In this tutorial we created a simple listing that touched on many of the features
of the BIRT Report Designer and Report Object Model (ROM). Now that you are
familiar with BIRT, you're ready to learn more about it.

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>
Additional BIRT topics include:

<ul>
<li>Scripting and expressions using JavaScript
<li>Custom data access extensions
<li>Advanced formatting
<li>Advanced queries
<li>Multi-part reports (multiple lists, side-by-side lists, master-detail
reports, etc.)
<li>Conditional formatting
<li>Extended data items
</ul>

<h1>BIRT Project Status</h1>
<p>
Keep in mind, as you use BIRT, that it is currently in the community review
cycle. It still has a few bugs and rough edges. We encourage you to try BIRT
and report problems and suggestions via <a href="../community.html">Bugzilla</a>.
