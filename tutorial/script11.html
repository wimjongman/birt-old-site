<p class="subhead">Cascading Styles</p>

<h1>About Style Cascade</h1>
<p>
We've mentioned that BIRT uses CSS to define the styles for report items,
and we saw how to define and apply our own style. BIRT also follows the
"cascade" part of Cascading Style Sheets: you can set a property once for the
report, or a container, and have that value <i>cascade</i> down through the
contents of the container.
<p>
In BIRT, Grid, List and Table items are containers: they can hold other
report items. The report itself is the ultimate container for all report items.

<h1>Setting Report-Wide Properties</h1>
<p>
Our report currently uses the default font: a serif style. (Actually, by default
BIRT uses the font set in your browser. Many browsers use a serif style by default,
but if you've changed your default browser font, that is how the report will
appear.)
<p>
Let's use a sans-serif
style instead. We do this by creating a style using a BIRT-defined style name.
If you familiar with CSS, this is like defining a style that selects the HTML
body tag.

<ul>
<li>Open or locate the Outline view.
<li>Scroll down to the bottom to find the Styles node.
<li>Use the context menu and select New Style.
<li>In the General page, enter the name "report". It must be all lower case,
and without the quotes. (This is a style name defined by BIRT itself.)
<li>In the Font page, choose "sans serif" as the font type.
<li>Click OK.
<li>All items in your report will change to sans-serif font.
</ul>
<p>
The names "serif" and "sans-serif" are defined by CSS: they are generic font
styles that don't depend on the specific fonts installed on a machine. This helps
to avoid depending on specific fonts, especially if your reports will be appear
as part of a public web site.
<p>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
The new style does not appear in the preview, though it does appear in the
layout view. This is a known problem.
Note: this has been fixed in the S20050314 stable build.
</div>

<h1>Other Default Styles</h1>
<p>
BIRT defines default styles for most report items and for list and table bands.
See the <a href="/birt/ref/ROM_Styles_SPEC.pdf">ROM Styles Specification</a>
for the complete list.

<h1>Check the Report</h1>
<p>
Let's click the preview tab to see how our report looks after the formatting.
Not bad, but we still need the report heading.
