<p class="subhead">Building a Table</p>

<h1>About Tables</h1>

BIRT provides a variety of <i>report items</i> for use when creating your report.
Report items appear in the Palette view.
Report items include:

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>Displays a simple piece of text such as "Customer Name".</dd>

<dt>Data</dt>
<dd>Displays a database column or a computed value. Provides formatting.</dd>

<dt>Text</dt>
<dd>Text that can include HTML formatting and computed values. Used to create
headings, form letters, "mail-merge" effects, etc.</dd>

<dt>Image</dt>
<dd>Any kind of image supported by a web browser. Images can be <i>embedded</i>
in the report, or links to a file on your web server.</dd>

<dt>Grid</dt>
<dd>Provide a tabular arrangement of report items, much like an HTML table.</dd>

<dt>Table</dt>
<dd>Presents data from a data set in the form of a table. Can contain grouping levels.
Like an HTML table that has a table row for each data set row.</dd>

<dt>List</dt>
<dd>Presents data from a data set in any kind of format. Used when the layout for
each row is more sophisticated than a simple table row.</dd>

</dl>

This tutorial will use all the elements except for List.

<h1>Create the Table Detail</h1>

The New Report dialog created a starter report that contains just a table with
one level of grouping. If we'd chosen a blank report, we could create the table
simply by dragging it from the palette.
<p>
The next step is to add some content to the table. We'll start with the <i>detail
band</i>. The detail band repeats to display each row from our data set. Here's how:

<ul>
<li>Display the Data Explorer if it's not already visible.
<li>Expand the Data Sets node of the tree.
<li>Expand the entry for the Customers data set that we created. This will display
the columns available from the data set.
<li>Select the customName column.
<li>Locate the detail band within the table.
<li>Drag the customName column into the detail band cell that is second from the
left.
<li>Repeat the above steps to drag the phone column into the last cell in the
detail band.
</ul>

<h1>Create the State Group</h1>

Next, we want to create the group heading for states. Using a group causes all
rows within the same state to appear together.

<ul>
<li>Locate the Group Header column in your table.
<li>Drag the state column into the leftmost cell within the group heading.
<li>Click in an empty cell. This will display a set of column and row headings
in the form of gray boxes much like those in Microsoft Excel. (We'll call this
the "table scaffolding." It helps us edit the table.)
<li>Open the context menu for the row header for the Group Header row.
<li>Choose Edit Group. The Group dialog will appear.
<li>In the Group On field, choose the state column. (Note: this probably was
already done for you when you dropped the column into the header.)
<li>Click OK.
</ul>

<p>
We are using the group created for us by the New Report
dialog. If we'd started by dragging the table from the palette, we'd create
this first group as we'll explain in the next section.
</p>
<p>
You must <i>bind</i> (associate) the table to a data set 
before you
can create a group. The binding happened automatically when we dropped the
first data set column into the table. However, if you build a table on your
own, you can use the Binding tab in the Property Editor to bind the table to
as data set.
</p>

<h1>Create the City Group</h1>

Next, we need to create a city group within the state. This makes sure that
customers are first grouped by state, then by city.

<ul>
<li>Click in an empty cell to display the table scaffolding.
<li>Choose Insert Group from the context menu. The Edit Group dialog again appears.
<li>Chose the city column in the Group On field.
<li>Click OK.
<li>We need another table column to display our group heading. Ensure the table
scaffolding appears. Click on the gray box column header for the first column.
<li>Choose Insert --&gt; Column to the Right. A new column appears.
<li>Drag the city column from the Data Explorer into the second column of the
second group header.
</ul>

<h1>Create Column Headings</h1>

We're almost done with basic setup of our table. We just need to add column headings.
BIRT added headings for us for the columns in the detail band.

<ul>
<li>Drag a label from the Palette into the first cell of the Header row in table.
<li>Type "State" and press Enter.
<li>Repeat this to add a label to the second colum header. Type "City".
<li>The third table column has a heading, but we want to change the text.
Double-click on the text to change it.
<li>Type "Name".
<li>Repeat the above step to change the last column heading to "Phone".
</ul>
