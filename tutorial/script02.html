<p class="head">BIRT Tutorial</p>
<p class="subhead">Creating a Report</p>

<h1>Create a Project</h1>
<p>
Eclipse uses projects to organize your files. So, the first step is to create a new project.  For this demo, let's create a project called "My Reports":

<ul>
<li>Choose File&rarr;New&rarr;Project. The new project dialog appears.
<li>Open the "Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools" group and choose 
"Report Project&quot;.
<li>Click Next.
<li>Type "My Reports" (without the quotes) as the project name.
<li>Click Finish.
<li>Click OK if asked to switch to the Report Design perspective. (This occurs 
if you create a BIRT project while in a perspective other than Report Design.)</ul>

<h1>Create a Report</h1>
<p>
We're now ready to create our first report:<ul>
<li>Choose File&rarr;New&rarr;Report. The new report dialog appears.
<li>In the tree view, choose the project we just created: My Reports.
<li>Enter the following in the file name field: Customers.rptdesign.<li>Click Next.</ul>

<p>You can create a report in three ways: as a blank report, by using a 
BIRT-defined template, or by copying one of your report designs. The second page 
of the New Report dialog provides two of these options. Since we want to use a 
template, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select &quot;Create Report from a predefined template&quot;</li>
  <li>Click Next.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Choose a Template</h1>
<p>
The next page of the New Report dialog presents a selection of report templates.
Before we choose the one we want, let's walk though what's available.

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Blank Report
<dd>A simple blank report with no content.

<dt>Simple Listing
<dd>A tabular listing with no grouping.

<dt>Grouped Listing
<dd>A tabular listing with grouping. Grouping shows
repeated values just once. Grouping also allows you to create
subtotals.

<dt>Chart &amp; Listing
<dd>A tabular listing that adds a chart to the top
of the report.

<dt>Dual Chart &amp; Listing
<dd>Combines charts and tables so you can display two
sets of related data in a single report.

<dt>Side by Side Chart &amp; Listing
<dd>A visual variation of the above.

<dt>Mailing Labels
<dd>Prints mailing labels on special
label stock on your printer.

<dt>Letter
<dd>A form letter in which database data is "mail-merged" into the
text. The letter text can be formatted using a subset of HTML.
</dl>
<p>
<p class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note</span>: 
Only the Blank Report, Simple Listing and Grouped Listing and
Letter work in this build.</p>
<p class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Build S20050328 Note</span>:
All templates
work as of this build, but a few are scheduled for additional improvements.</p>
<p>
We're now ready to choose our template:

<ul>
<li>Select the Grouped Listing.
<li>Click Finish.</ul>

<p>BIRT opens your new report in the Eclipse workspace.</p>
