<p class="subhead">Editing &amp; Testing a Data Set</p>

<h1>Edit a Data Set</h1>
<p>
Like the data source, the data set appears in the Data Explorer. We can use the
data set editor to both change and test the data set.

<ul>
<li>Find or open the Data Explorer.
<li>Open the Data Sets node.
<li>Double-click the Customers data set. The Data Set editor opens.
</ul>

<h1>Data Set Editor Pages</h1>
<p>
The data set editor provides the following pages:

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Query
<dd>Displays your SQL SELECT statement. You can edit this
statement to add a WHERE clause, adjust the set of selected columns, and
more.

<dt>Computed Columns
<dd>Computed columns are calculated by BIRT and appear
to the rest of the report just like any other column. You can use JavaScript
expressions, and even call into Java for advanced business logic.

<dt>Input Parameters
<dd>SQL SELECT statements can include <i>input
parameters</i> that pass data into the query. They are marked using the SQL ?
symbol in the query. This page lets you give the parameters a name, a default
value, and so on. There must be a one-to-one coorespondence between entries
on this page and the ? symbols in your query.

<dt>Filters
<dd>Additional filters applied to your data. Filters restrict
the data passed to the report. The WHERE clause
is also a filter: one executed by the database. This tab lets you define additional
filters using BIRT (JavaScript) scripting.

<dt>Output Columns
<dd>Shows the columns within the query, and lets you define
a column <i>alias</i> for use in the report. Note that this view shows the columns
as the report will see them. The Query page shows the columns as selected from
the database.

<dt>Preview Results
<dd>Lets you test your query and see the output. Very handy
to make sure that the data is right before you proceed with report design.

</dl>

For now, we're just going to test our query.

<h1>Test a Data Set</h1>
<p>
With the data set editor open, do the following:

<ul>
<li>Click on the Preview Results item.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The preview page appears. This page
shows the columns selected in your query listed across the top.
The actual rows in your query appear down the page.

<ul>
<li>Verify that the list of customers appears.
<li>Click OK to close the data set editor.
</ul>
