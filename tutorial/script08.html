<h1>Testing your Report</h1>
<p>
We're now ready to test the report layout. We verified the
data set earlier, so now we want to verify that the report is presenting the
data as we expected.
<p>
We preview the report by clicking on the Preview tab within the report editor.
If our report had parameters, the GUI would ask us for them. But, since this
report does not have parameters, it simply runs.
<p>
The window that appears is a simple web browser, and displays the report in
HTML. The report appears as a single page. This works well for the small
amount of data in our sample. If our database had more data, we'd want to use
a report parameter and a data set filter to limit the amount of data displayed
at any one time.
<p>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0 Note:</span>
BIRT Release 1.0 displays the report as a single
HTML page. Future releases will display the report as a series of pages.</div>
<p>
Seeing the report in the preview suggests a number of ways we can improve the
report's appearance:

<ul>
<li>Add a title to the top of the report.
<li>Add some color to enhance the column headings.
<li>Shrink the size of the city and state columns.
<li>Add some color to make the state and city group headers stand out.
<li>Format the phone numbers.
</ul>

Before we fix these issues, let's look at other ways to preview the report.

<h1>Other Ways to Preview</h1>
<p>
The Preview tab is handy for a quick review of your report. BIRT runs the report each
time you switch to Preview. However, you can have either the Layout or the
Preview tab open, but not both.
<p>
Instead, we can preview the report in a separate window. Find the Preview button in
the toolbar. Use the little arrow next to it to open the pulldown. You can then
Preview as HTML in a separate window. This allows you to switch back and forth
between your layout editor and your preview without rerunning the report.
<p>
You can also choose Preview as PDF. This converts the layout to a multi-page
PDF format.

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0 Note:</span> 
BIRT Release 1.0 uses the Apache XML-FO Processor
(FOP) package. Limitations in the current version of FOP cause problems with
the way the report apepars in PDF. The BIRT team is aware of the problems and
is working to address them in a later release.</div>
