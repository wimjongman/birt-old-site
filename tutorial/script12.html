<p class="head">BIRT Tutorial</p>
<p class="subhead">Using a Grid</p>

<h1>Create a Grid</h1>
<p>
Let's add a heading to our report.
Our report heading will use the classic "left/center/right" layout: a logo on the
left, the report title in the center, and the run date on the right.
<p>
The easiest way to create such a layout is to use a grid. A grid is like an
HTML table, it tells BIRT the desired layout, and BIRT does the work to make it
happen. In this case, we want a one-row grid with three columns each 1/3 the
width of the table.

<ul>
<li>Drag a Grid item from the palette into your report above your table.
<p>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
It is currently difficult to drop the grid in
the right place. Watch for a vertical black line to the left of the table. If
all else fails, drop it under the table, in the right half of the page, then move
it above the table.</div>
<p>
<li>Delete the last row by clicking the Grid's tab, then on the gray header
to the left of the row. Press Delete.
<li>Delete the second row the same way.
<li>Select the three column headers.
<p>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
The current build does not support multiple
selection of columns. For now, just set each column individually.</div>
<p>
<li>Switch to the General tab in the Property Editor. Notice that the width
is unset. As in HTML,
if the column width is not set, BIRT will size the column to its content.
<li>Set the column widths to 33%. Do this by typing "33" in the width field,
then selecting "%" from the adjacent pulldown.
<li>Select the middle column. In the General page of the Property Editor,
set the text alignment to Center.
<li>Select the rightmost column. In the General page of the Property Editor,
set the text alignment to Right.
</ul>

<h1>Insert an Image</h1>
<p>
Next, let's add the company logo to the heading. We'll link to an image on the
BIRT web site; but you can also <i>embed</i> an image located on your local disk.

<ul>
<li>Drag an Image item from the palette into the left-most cell of your grid.
<li>The Image Builder dialog appears.
<li>Ensure that the URL radio button is selected.
<li>Enter the following URL: http://www.eclipse.org/birt/tutorial/multichip-4.jpg.
<li>Click the Preview button to ensure that the URL is correct.
<li>Click Insert to add the image to your report.
</ul>

<h1>Insert the Run Date</h1>
<p>
Next, let's display the current date in the right-most cell in the heading.

<ul>
<li>Drag a Data item from the Palette into the right-most cell of your grid.
<li>The expression builder will appear.
<li>Display the current date.
<p>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
The current date functionality is not
yet available. For now, simulate it by typing "Mar. 1, 2005" with the quotes.</div>
<p>
<li>Click OK.
<li>Set the date format. Select the Format page within the Property Editor.
<li>Choose "Medium Date" for the date format.
</ul>
<p>
BIRT uses Java formatting (based on Microsoft Excel) for dates, numbers and 
strings. In
addition, BIRT adds a number of specialized, locale-independent date formats
described in the
<a href="/birt/ref/ROM_Styles_SPEC.pdf">ROM Styles Specification</a>.
