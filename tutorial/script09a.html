<p class="subhead">Setting Data Properties</p>

<h1>About Data Properties</h1>

<p>In addition to the visual properties we just saw, BIRT provides a set of 
data-related properties for each report item. We'll use these to control the 
sort order of the customers within our report.</p>

<p>Data sets in BIRT are reusable: you can use the same data set multiple times. 
For example, suppose you want to show year-to-date (YTD) sales three ways: by 
month, by sales rep, and as a chart. With BIRT, you define the data set once, 
but present it three times. Each use of the data set can provide data properties 
that customize the data set to that particular use.</p>

<p>Data properties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data set binding: lets you specify the data set to use with any given 
  report item.</li>
  <li>Parameter binding: you can pass data into the data set. For example, you 
  can create a &quot;master/detail&quot; subreport by using data set parameters to pass 
  data from the current row in the master report to the detail for the 
  subreport. For example, you can obtain a list of customers from one database, 
  then have the subreport display orders from a different database.</li>
  <li>Filters: provide filter conditions unique to a given presentation. For 
  example, a list of transactions might list all transactions, but then use 
  filters to display sales in one chart, returns in another.</li>
  <li>Groups: provide ability to create subtotals in addition to visual affects 
  we've seen so far.</li>
  <li>Sorting: controls the order of the detail rows within a table. This is the 
  property we'll use.</li>
</ul>

Setting the Detail Sort</h1>
<p>

We're ready to specify the sort order for customers within our report.<ul>
  <li>Select the table.</li>
  <li>Choose the Sorting tab within the Property Editor. (Note: Sorting is a tab 
  on the bottom, not a page on the left as we've used thus far.)</li>
  <li>Click the Add button to add a new line.</li>
  <li>Use the pull-down under Sort Key to choose &quot;CUSTOMERNAME&quot;.</li>
  <li>Leave the Sort Direction at Ascending.</li>
  </ul>
