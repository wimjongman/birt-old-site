<p class="subhead">Setting Visual Properties</p>

<h1>Resizing Table Columns</h1>
<p>
Let's adjust the size of the table columns. Tables &amp; columns can
be sized using absolute sizes (inches, centimeters), or relative sizes (percentage
of the width of the page.) Here, we'll adjust the column widths by directly
changing the size.

<ul>
<li>Click the Layout tab to switch back to the report layout.
<li>Click on any empty cell within the table to display the "scaffolding."
<li>Find the black line that separates the two column headings.
<li>With the cursor over this line, hold down the left mouse button and
resize the column to be about big enough to hold the two-letter state
code.
<li>Repeat the above to resize the city column.
</ul>

<h1>Setting the Background Color</h1>
<p>
Let's dress up the state heading. Let's give it
a color band by setting the row's background color.

<ul>
<li>Select the state group header row by clicking on the gray box to the left
of the row. (Remember to click on an empty cell to display the scaffolding.)
<li>Locate or open the Property Editor.
<li>A list of property types appears at the left of the view. Click on the General
group.
<li>Find the Background color field. Click on the empty gray button to display the
color chooser.
<li>Pick the blue color third from the right in the top row. This is a standard
color, but is a bit too dark for our needs.
<li>Click on the "Define Custom Color" button.
<li>Take the right-most slider (saturation) and move it up to produce a very light
blue.
<li>Click OK.
</ul>

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
The selected color does not appear in the layout
view in the current build. However, the property was set and will appear in the
preview.</div>

<h1>Setting the Font</h1>
<p>
Now, let's give the state a bold font. We'll also dress up the city group heading
by giving it a dark blue, bold, larger font.

<ul>
<li>Select the state data item.
<li>Switch to the General property group in the Property Editor.
<li>Find the Font size field. Change the size to "Large".
<li>Click the [B] (bold) button to make the font bold.
<li>Select the city data item.
<li>Again, switch to the General property group.
<li>Set the font size to Large.
<li>Click on the Font Color button.
<li>The color chooser again opens. Again choose the blue that is third from the right
in the top row.
<li>Click OK.
</ul>

<h1>Formatting Data</h1>
<p>
We want to format the phone numbers so that they have correct North American
format: (123) 555-1212. We do this by applying a string format to the phone number
field. Formats are also available for dates and numbers.

<ul>
<li>Select the phone number item.
<li>Switch to the Format group in the Property Editor.
<li>Enter the following for the String Format: (@@@) @@@-@@@@.
</ul>

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
For now, you must press Enter after you type in a value such as the format above.
If you
directly click into the Layout view, BIRT will discard your changes. This is a
known issue.</div>

<h1>Setting a Border</h1>
<p>
Next, let's put a "drop shadow" border around our table.

<ul>
<li>Select the table by moving your cursor over the table, then
clicking on the Table tab that appears.
<li>Select the Borders page in the Property Editor.
<li>Set the Style field to a solid line.
<li>Set the Color field to a black. (Use the color name pulldown, or choose the
bottom left color in the color chooser.)
<li>Set the Width property to the thinest line.
<li>Click the top and left border buttons.
<li>Set the Width property to the second thinest line.
<li>Click the bottom and right border buttons.
</ul>

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span> 
Once you select some other item, the Property
Editor will no longer display your border settings. The properties are still set,
but the UI does not display them. This is a known issue that will be fixed
shortly.</div>

<h1>More on Properties</h1>
<p>
BIRT provide a wide variety of properties for formatting report items. The properties
are based on the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">W3C CSS<a>
(Cascading Style Sheet) standard. If you've ever used CSS
to format HTML, you are well on your way to understanding formatting in BIRT.
<p>
BIRT adds additional, report-specific properties such as the date, number and string
formatting that we just set. However, even these act just like CSS properties.
