<p class="head">BIRT Tutorial</p>
<p class="subhead">Getting Started</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This brief tutorial walks you through building a simple report with BIRT.
It introduces the major UI features, and many of the BIRT reporting elements.
At the completion of this tutorial, you should be able to start building your
own reports using your own database.
<p>
We'll create a simple customer listing report, with the customers grouped by
state and city. For each customer, we'll display a name and phone number.

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">Build S20050328 Note</span>:
The instructions here have been updated for the latest 
stable build. If you are using an earlier build, some of steps might be a bit 
different.

<h1>Install BIRT</h1>
<p>
If you have not yet done so, install Eclipse, GEF, EMF and BIRT. You'll find complete
instructions for doing so on the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/">BIRT Download</a> page.

<h1>Install the Sample Database</h1>
<p>
This tutorial uses a Microsoft Access database called "sfdata". You'll need to copy
it to your system and install it. Of course, this only works on Windows.

<ul>
<li><a href="sfdata.zip">Download</a> this zip file.
<li>Unzip sfdata.mdb into a convenient location.
<li>Create an ODBC System DSN for this database called "sfdata"
</ul>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Note:</span>
This database is a temporary solution; the team is developing a new sample 
  database based on MySQL and Cloudscape.</div>

<h1>Open BIRT</h1>
<p>
BIRT is a perspective within Eclipse. To open it, use the Window item on the
Eclipse main menu. Choose Open Perspective, then Report Design. If report Design 
does not appear directly in the Open Perspective window, then choose Other... A list of perspectives
will appear. Choose Report Design.
<p>
Eclipse will switch to display the BIRT perspective.

<h1>
Example Report</h1>
<p>
If you get stuck as you work through the tutorial, or if you want to see the 
finished report right away, simply download it:<ul>
  <li>Use your browser to download the report: <a href="customers.rptdesign">
  customers.rptdesign</a>.</li>
  <li>Save the file into an Eclipse project directory. (See the next page if you 
  don't yet have a project.)</li>
  <li>Your browser may store this as an XML file. If so, rename it back the the 
  name above.</li>
  <li>Within Eclipse, select your project in the Navigator view and choose 
  Refresh from the right-click context menu.</li>
  <li>Double-click the report to open it in the BIRT report designer.</li>
  </ul>
