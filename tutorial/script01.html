<p class="head">BIRT Tutorial</p>
<p class="subhead">Getting Started</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This brief tutorial walks you through building a simple report with BIRT.
It introduces the major UI features, and many of the BIRT reporting elements.
At the completion of this tutorial, you should be able to start building your
own reports using your own database.
<p>
We'll create a simple customer listing report, with the customers grouped by
state and city. For each customer, we'll display the name and phone number.

<h1>Install BIRT</h1>
<p>
If you have not yet done so, install Eclipse, GEF and BIRT. You'll find complete
instructions for doing so on the
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/">BIRT Download</a> page.

<h1>Install the Sample Database</h1>
<p>
This tutorial uses a Microsoft Access database called "sfdata". You'll need to copy
it to your system and install it. Of course, this only works on Windows.

<ul>
<li><a href="sfdata.zip">Download</a> this zip file.
<li>Unzip sfdata.mdb into a convenient location.
<li>Create an ODBC System DSN for this database called "sfdata"
</ul>
<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Note:</span>
This database is a temporary solution; the team is
reviewing open source sample database choices.</div>

<h1>Open BIRT</h1>
<p>
BIRT is a perspective within Eclipse. To open it, use the Window item on the
Eclipse main menu. Choose Open Perspective, then Other... A list of perspectives
will appear. Choose Report Design.
<p>
Eclipse will switch to display the BIRT perspective.
