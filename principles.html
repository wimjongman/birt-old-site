  <tr> 
    <td colspan="2">Among the key principles on which this project has been initiated, 
      and will be run, are the following: <br>
      <br>
      <b>Extension of the Eclipse value proposition</b> - The Eclipse Project 
      has set a high standard for technical excellence, functional innovation 
      and overall extensibility within the Java IDE domain. We intend to apply 
      these same standards to the business intelligence and reporting domain. 
      <br>
      <b><br>
      Leverage Eclipse ecosystem</b> - A major goal of this project is to apply 
      the application development strengths of the Eclipse Project to the business 
      intelligence and reporting domain. The project will work closely with other 
      Eclipse project areas whenever possible to leverage the capabilities being 
      developed in those areas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vertical Solutions</b> - Reporting and Business intelligence are a facet 
      of almost all applications that are developed today. A core principle of 
      this project is to provide a general purpose reporting capability that can 
      easily and seamlessly be integrated as a component of vertical applications 
      and solutions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Extensibility</b> - To meet the varied requirements for reporting and 
      Business Intelligence, provide extension points that enable developers to 
      adapt the technology to meet application specific needs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vendor neutrality</b> - We aim to encourage Eclipse participation and 
      drive Eclipse market acceptance by providing vendor-neutral capabilities 
      and to encourage participation for complementary capabilities through additional 
      projects.<br>
      <b><br>
      Open, standards-based development</b> - Where market adopted standards exist 
      that meet the design goals, our aim is to leverage and adhere to them. Where 
      market adopted standards do not exist, we will develop and publish any new 
      capabilities in the Eclipse open forum. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Incremental delivery</b> - In order to meet the pent-up demand for reporting 
      within the Java application market, a goal is to delivery functionality 
      to market as rapidly as possible via an incremental delivery model.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Agile development</b> - Our aim is to incorporate into our planning process 
      the innovations that arise once a project is underway, and the feedback 
      from our user community on our achievements to date. We think an agile development 
      and planning process, in which progress is incremental, near-term deliverables 
      are focused, and long-term planning is flexible, will be the best way to 
      achieve this.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Inclusiveness &amp; diversity</b> - We aim to assimilate the best ideas 
      from the largest number of participants representing the needs of the widest 
      range of end-users. So we will encourage organizations across a broad range 
      of technical, market and geographical domains to participate in this project.<br>
