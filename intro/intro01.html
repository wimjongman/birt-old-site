<p class="head">Overview of BIRT</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
BIRT is an Eclipse-based open source reporting system for web applications,
especially those based on Java and J2EE. BIRT has two main components: a report
designer based on Eclipse, and a runtime component that you can add to your
app server.
<p>
BIRT also offers a charting engine that lets you add charts to your own application.
<p>
BIRT is currently in community review for release 1.0. We encourage you to download
BIRT, try it, and give us your feedback though the newgroups and Bugzilla.
<p>
With BIRT, you can add a rich variety of reports to your application.

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Lists
<dd>The simplest reports are lists of data. As the lists get longer, you can add
grouping to organize related data together (orders grouped by customer, products
grouped by supplier). If your data is numeric, you can easily add totals, averages
and other summaries.

<dt>Charts
<dd>Numeric data is much easier to understand when presented as a chart. BIRT
provides pie charts, line &amp; bar charts and many more.

<dt>Crosstabs
<dd>Crosstabs (also called a cross-tabulation or matrix) shows data in two
dimensions: sales per quarter or hits per web page. (Crosstabs are not yet
in Release 1.0, but are planned for a future release.)

<dt>Letters &amp; Documents
<dd>Notices, form letters, and other textual documents are easy to create with BIRT.
Documents can include text, formatting, lists, charts and more.

<dt>Compound Reports
<dd>Many reports need to combine the above into a single document. For example, a
customer statement may list the information for the customer, provide text about
current promotions, and provide side-by-side lists of payments and charges. A
financial report may include disclaimers, charts, tables all with extensive formatting
that matches corporate color schemes.

<h1>The Anatomy of a Report</h1>
<p>
BIRT reports consist of four main parts: data, data transforms, 
business logic and presentation.

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Data
<dd>Databases, web services, Java objects all can supply data to your BIRT report.
Release 1.0 provides JDBC support, as well as support for using code to get at
other sources of data. BIRT's Open Data Access (ODA) framework allows anyone to
build new UI and runtime support for any kind of tabular data. Further, a single
report can include data from any number of data sources.

<dt>Data Transforms
<dd>Reports present data sorted, summarized, filtered and grouped to fit the user's
needs. While databases can do some of this work, BIRT must do it for "simple" data
sources such as flat files or Java objects. BIRT allows sophisticated operations
such as grouping on sums, percentages of overall totals and more.

<dt>Business Logic
<dd>Real-world data is seldom structured exactly as you'd like for a report.
Many reports require business-specific logic to convert raw data into information
useful for the user. If the logic is just for the report, you can script it using
BIRT's JavaScript support. If your application already contains the logic, you can
call into your existing Java code.

<dt>Presentation
<dd>Once the data is ready, you have a wide range of options for presenting it to
the user. Tables, charts, text and more. A single data set can appear in multiple
ways, and a single report can present data from multiple data sets.
