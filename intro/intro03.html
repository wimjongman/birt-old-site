<p class="head">BIRT Report Designer</p>

<h1>Report Designer</h1>
<p>
Application development with BIRT starts with the report designer. This
Eclipse-based plugin offers a variety of tools to build reports quickly.

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Data Explorer
<dd>Organizes your data sources (connections) and data sets (queries). The data
set editor allows you to test your data set to ensure the report receives the
correct data.

<dt>Layout View
<dd>WYSIWYG editor that provides drag &amp; drop
creation of the presentation portion of your report. Includes a palette of
standard report items.

<dt>Property Editor
<dd>Presents the most commonly used properties in a convenient format that makes
editing quick and easy. BIRT also integrates with the standard Eclipse property
view to provide a detailed listing of all properties for an item.

<dt>Report Preview
<dd>You can test your report at any time with real data. The preview is a window
directly within Eclipse.

<dt>Code Editor
<dd>Scripting adds business logic to reports during data access, during report
generation, or during viewing. The code editor provides standard Eclipse features
for editing your scripts: syntax coloring, auto-complete and more. BIRT expressions
are really just simple scripts, and an expression builder makes it easy to build
expressions.

<dt>Outline
<dd>BIRT reports are organized as a tree structure with the overall report as the
root, and separate categories for styles, report content, data sourcs, data sets,
report parameters and more. The Outline view provies a compact overview of your
entire report structure.

<dt>Cheat Sheets
<dd>Learning a new tool is always a challenge, but Eclipse offers an innovative
solution: cheat sheets. These are short bits of documentation that walk you
through new tasks.
