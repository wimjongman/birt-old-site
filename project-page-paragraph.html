<p><b><a href="/birt/">Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools</a></b> <br/>
<p>The BIRT project provides a business intelligence and reporting framework that
 integrates easily with existing infrastructure and applications.  
 The project provides extensible tools and APIs for building and deploying reports 
 to environments ranging from Java/J2EE to PHP -- both web and desktop, 
 including Eclipse-based applications. BIRT is based on open source standards, 
 and allows designers to provide functionality for data mining and analysis, 
 drill through and SVG rendered interactive graphs.  
 The BIRT platform is extensible, facilitating the input of new data sources, 
 export of custom formats and support of custom report components.
