<p class="head">Integrating BIRT</p>
<p class="subhead">Overview</p>

<h1>Integration Points</h1>

<p>BIRT reporting provides a variety of integration points to accomplish various tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#runtime">Runtime integration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#design">Design-time integration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#extensions">Extensions to BIRT</a></li>
</ul>

<p>BIRT charting APIs are described elsewhere. (Not yet available.)
</p>

<h1><a name="runtime">Runtime Integration</a></h1>

<p>Your application can integrate the BIRT web and engine runtimes:</p>
<dl class="break-list">
<dt><a href="#viewer">BIRT Report Viewer</a></dt>
<dd>A series of URLs that your application can
use to display a parameter page, run and display a report, etc.
</dd>

<dt><a href="#engine-api">Report Engine API</a> (Not yet available.) </dt>
<dd>A Java interface used to embed the BIRT report engine within your application.
The engine behavior can be customized for use in a web app, RCP app, command
line app, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a name="design">Design-Time Integration</a></h1>

<p>Your application can explore or create BIRT XML report designs:</p>
<dl class="break-list">

<dt><a href="#deapi">Design Engine API</a></dt>
<dd>Provides access to a BIRT report design. You can explore the design,
modify it and so on. Use this API to create your own custom report designer,
or to perform batch tasks on designs.</dd>
<dt><a href="viewer-php.html">Generate a Report Design Directly</a></dt>
<dd>If you can write XML files, or with  templates, you can generate report 
designs based on an application-specific report designer. This technique is 
ideal for non-Java scripting environments such as PHP.</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a name="extensions">Extending BIRT</a></h1>

<p>Your application can extend BIRT for your specific needs:</p>
<dl class="break-list">

<dt><a href="../ref/ROM_Scripting_SPEC.pdf">Scripting</a> (Reference only 
currently available.)</dt>
<dd>BIRT provides extensive scripting support. You can create anything from 
computed columns to sophisticated business logic to extensive integration with 
existing Java code.</dd>

<dt>Open Data Access (ODA) Extension API (Not yet available.) </dt>
<dd>BIRT provides a JDBC data source. Use the ODA API to create custom
data sources drivers. Each driver has run-time behavior along with
optional design-time UI.</dd>
<dt>Scripted Data Source (Not yet available.)</dt>
<dd>The scripted data source and data set elements allow you to access custom 
data sources directly from your report without the need to create an ODA driver. 
This solution is ideal for one-off data sources, prototypes, and the like.</dd>

<dt>BIRT Model Extension API (Not yet available.) </dt>
<dd>The BIRT model is extensible; you can add new report items. Use this
API to include design-time, run-time or presentation-time behavior.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Status</h1>
<p>
The deployment portions of the BIRT project are still being refined. The information
here may (and probably will) change as Release 1.0 approaches. On the other hand,
this means that there is still time to provide your comments and suggestions via
the <a href="../community.html">news group</a>.
</p>

<h1><a name="viewer">Report Viewer</a></h1>

<p>The BIRT Viewer can be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a stand-alone, pre-built web application for running and viewing 
  reports.</li>
  <li>As a starter web application that you can customize to your 
  needs.</li>
  <li>As an example for learning how to build your own reporting web application, 
  or to learn how to use the BIRT engine.</li>
  <li>As a way to run a report using a URL. This option provides a simple way to 
  integrate BIRT reporting into applications build using non-Java technology 
  such as Perl, PHP or even static web pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>The BIRT viewer is a web application included with BIRT to perform the report 
preview operation within Eclipse. It is also a sample of how to integrate birt 
with a web application.</p>

<ul class="arrow-list">
  <li><a href="viewer-deploy.html">Integrating the BIRT Viewer</a> explains how to 
  deploy the BIRT viewer onto your own application server. The explanation uses
  Apache Jakarta Tomcat as the sample deployment target.</li>
  <li><a href="viewer-use.html">Using the BIRT Viewer</a> discusses 
  the viewer operation URLs and their parameters.</li>
  <li><a href="viewer-php.html">Using the Viewer from PHP</a> discusses how to
  run BIRT reports from a non-Java scripting environment such as PHP. Also 
  briefly summarizes how to use PHP to generate custom report designs.</li>
  <li>Viewer Pages discusses the JSP that make up the viewer. (Not yet available.)
  <li>The viewer code itself is available in the BIRT CVS repository in the
  <a href="../frameizer.php?page=http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/source/org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer/?cvsroot=BIRT_Project">
  org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer</a> project. See the
  <a href="../build/build_instr.html">BIRT build instructions</a> for 
  information on how to access CVS and build the viewer.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="engine-api">Report Engine API</a></h1>
<p>Use the Report Engine API to run BIRT reports directly from Java code or to 
create a custom web application front end for BIRT.</p>
<p>BIRT will provide an engine SDK, and an engine runtime. The engine SDK will 
be part of the BIRT designer download, while the runtime will be a separate 
download.</p>
<h1><a name="deapi">Design Engine API</a></h1>
<p>Use the Design Engine API (DE API) to create a custom report designer tool, 
or to explore or modify BIRT report designs. The BIRT Designer is built using 
this API. This API is described in Javadoc in the <code>org.eclipse.birt.report.model.api</code> 
package within the <code>org.eclipse.birt.report.model project</code>. Read the package 
overview for general information about getting started with this API.</p>
<p>At present, you'll need to download the project source code and build the 
Javadoc yourself. In time, the Javadoc, and the model JARs, will be available as 
part of a BIRT download.</p>
