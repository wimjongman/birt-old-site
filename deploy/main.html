<p class="head">Deploying BIRT</p>
<p class="subhead">Overview</p>

<h1>Integration Points</h1>

<p>BIRT provides two main solutions for integrating with your application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the BIRT Viewer web application, or a customized version</li>
  <li>Using the BIRT Report Engine in your application.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Status</h1>
<p>
The deployment portions of the BIRT project are still being refined. The information
here may (and probably will) change as Release 1.0 approaches. On the other hand,
this means that there is still time to provide your comments and suggestions via
the <a href="../community.html">news group</a>.

<h1>The BIRT Viewer</h1>

<p>The BIRT viewer is a web application that ships with BIRT to perform report 
preview within Eclipse.</p>
<ul class="arrow-list">
  <li><a href="viewer-deploy.html">Deploying the BIRT Viewer </a>explains how to 
  deploy the BIRT viewer onto your own application server. It uses Apache 
  Jakarta Tomcat as the sample deployment.</li>
  <li><a href="viewer-use.html">Understanding the Sample Viewer</a> discusses 
  the major components of the viewer application and how to customize them.</li>
  <li>Viewer Pages discusses the JSP that make up the viewer. (Not yet available.)
  <li>The viewer code itself is available in the BIRT CVS repository in the
  <a href="../frameizer.php?page=http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/source/org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer/?cvsroot=BIRT_Project">
  org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer</a> project. See the
  <a href="../build/build_instr.html">BIRT build instructions</a> for 
  information on how to access CVS and build the viewer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The BIRT Viewer can be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a stand-alone, pre-built web application for running and viewing 
  reports.</li>
  <li>As a starter web application that you can customize to your 
  needs.</li>
  <li>As an example for learning how to build your own reporting web application, 
  or to learn how to use the BIRT engine.</li>
  <li>As a way to run a report using a URL. This option provides a simple way to 
  integrate BIRT reporting into applications build using non-Java technology 
  such as Perl, PHP or even static web pages.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The BIRT Engine SDK</h1>

<p>You can also build an application that uses the BIRT Report Engine directly. 
This might be a web application, Eclipse plug-in or even a command-line 
application.</p>
<ul class="arrow-list">
  <li>Installing the BIRT Engine SDK explains how to install the Engine SDK and 
  how to use it within Eclipse. (Not yet available.)</li>
  <li>Installing the BIRT Runtime explains how to install and configure the BIRT 
  engine as part of your application. (Not yet available.)</li>
  <li>Working with the BIRT Engine explains how to integrate the BIRT engine 
  within your application. (Not yet available.)</li>
  <li>The sample Engine application is a simple, command-line application that 
  runs a report and illustrates the above topics. (Not yet available.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The BIRT engine is simply a series of jar files and can be deployed within a 
wide range of Java applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web application using your favorite application framework (JSP, servlet, 
  JSF, Struts, etc.)</li>
  <li>Traditional Java client application based on Swing.</li>
  <li>Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) application.</li>
  <li>Even as a command-line utility.</li>
</ul>
