<p class="head">Integrating BIRT</p>
<p class="subhead">Overview</p>

<h1>Integration Points</h1>

<p>The BIRT reporting solution provides two main solutions for integrating
with your application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the <a href="viewer-intro.html">BIRT Viewer</a> web application,
  or a customized version</li>
  <li>Using the <a href="engine-intro.html">BIRT Report Engine</a> in your
  application.</li>
</ul>

<h1>BIRT Reporting APIs</h1>
<p>
BIRT a number of APIs to accomplish a variety of tasks:
</p>
<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt><a href="#viewer">BIRT Report Viewer</a></dt>
<dd>A series of URLs that your application can
use to display a parameter page, run and display a report, etc.
</dd>

<dt>Report Engine API</dt>
<dd>A Java interface used to embed the BIRT report engine within your application.
The engine behavior can be customized for use in a web app, RCP app, command
line app, etc.</dd>

<dt>Design Engine API</dt>
<dd>Provides access to a BIRT report design. You can explore the design,
modify it and so on. Use this API to create your own custom report designer,
or to perform batch tasks on designs.</dd>

<dt>BIRT Model Extension API</dt>
<dd>The BIRT model is extensible; you can add new report items. Use this
API to include design-time, run-time or presentation-time behavior.</dd>

<dt>Open Data Access (ODA) Extension API</dt>
<dd>BIRT provides certain data source. Use the ODA API to create custom
data sources drivers. Each driver has run-time behavior along with
optional design-time UI.</dd>
</dl>

<p>BIRT charting APIs are described elsewhere. (Documents not yet available.)
</p>
<h1>Status</h1>
<p>
The deployment portions of the BIRT project are still being refined. The information
here may (and probably will) change as Release 1.0 approaches. On the other hand,
this means that there is still time to provide your comments and suggestions via
the <a href="../community.html">news group</a>.

<h1><a name="viewer">Report Viewer</a></h1>

<p>The BIRT Viewer can be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a stand-alone, pre-built web application for running and viewing 
  reports.</li>
  <li>As a starter web application that you can customize to your 
  needs.</li>
  <li>As an example for learning how to build your own reporting web application, 
  or to learn how to use the BIRT engine.</li>
  <li>As a way to run a report using a URL. This option provides a simple way to 
  integrate BIRT reporting into applications build using non-Java technology 
  such as Perl, PHP or even static web pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>The BIRT viewer is a web application that ships with BIRT to perform report 
preview within Eclipse.</p>

<ul class="arrow-list">
  <li><a href="viewer-deploy.html">Integrating the BIRT Viewer</a> explains how to 
  deploy the BIRT viewer onto your own application server. The explanation uses
  Apache Jakarta Tomcat as the sample deployment target.</li>
  <li><a href="viewer-use.html">Using the BIRT Viewer</a> discusses 
  the viewer operation URLs and their parameters.</li>
  <li>Viewer Pages discusses the JSP that make up the viewer. (Not yet available.)
  <li>The viewer code itself is available in the BIRT CVS repository in the
  <a href="../frameizer.php?page=http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/source/org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer/?cvsroot=BIRT_Project">
  org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer</a> project. See the
  <a href="../build/build_instr.html">BIRT build instructions</a> for 
  information on how to access CVS and build the viewer.</li>
</ul>
