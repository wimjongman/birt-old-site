<p class="head">Deploying BIRT</p>

<p class="subhead">Using Standalone Tomcat</p>

<h1>Using Tomcat</h1>

<p>The first step is to understand how to deploy the viewer to a J2EE container. 
We'll use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Apache Tomcat</a>, since 
it is open source and readily available. The same concepts, though perhaps 
different details, apply to other app servers. These instructions assume you'll 
install Tomcat on your own machine using the default port number of 8080.</p>

<p>The following instructions are for Tomcat version 5.5.7 but you 
should be able to use them for other versions with appropriate changes. If you 
don’t have Tomcat installed on your system you can download it from
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat</a>.</p>

<h1>Prepare Tomcat</h1>

<p>BIRT is tested for use with Java 1.4, but Tomcat 5.5 runs on Java 5 
by default. Be sure to download and install the compatibility package from the 
Tomcat download page. Then, configure Tomcat to use the Java 1.4 
runtime. The easiest way to do this is to use the Tomcat manager.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the Tomcat Properties dialog.</li>
<li>Switch to the Java page.</li>
<li>For Java Virtual Machine, enter the path to a Java 1.4 runtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, verify that the configuration is correct:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your browser, open the main page for Tomcat. This is 
localhost:8080 by default.</li>
  <li>Switch to the Status page. Make sure that the JVM version is 
from the 1.4 series.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Deploy the Viewer</h1>

<p>The next step is to deploy the BIRT viewer application.

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note</span>: 
The download page does not include a viewer build. Instead, 
we'll use the viewer packaged with the Report Designer. These instructions will 
change once a viewer build is available.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locate the Eclipse plugins directory.</li>
  <li>Find the org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer_0.0.1 plugin. Open this 
directory. It contains a single directory called viewer.</li>
  <li>Copy the viewer directory to the webapps directory of your 
Tomcat installation.</li>
  <li>Stop, then restart Tomcat.</li>
  <li>Display the Tomcat manager application and verify that the 
Viewer is deployed: <a href="http://localhost:8080/manager/html">
http://localhost:8080/manager/html</a>.</li>
  <li>Verify that Viewer is listed as an application, and that it is 
running.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to put the Viewer into some other location, you'll 
need to use a context entry within the server.xml file to indicate the 
deployment location. See Tomcat documentation for details. </p>

<h1>Test the Viewer</h1>

<p>We'll test the viewer by creating a test report and deploying it 
into the Viewer directory.

<ul>
  <li>Create a directory called reports within your webapps/viewer 
directory.</li>
  <li>Download the sample report into the webapps/viewer directory you 
just created.</li>
  <li>If you've installed everything in its default location, then 
  copy the following URL into your browser. Replace the <i>{Report Path}</i>
  with the name of the absolute path to your report, encoded for HTML.
  Note that the URL
  is broken into lines for readability.
<pre class="code-block">
http://localhost:8080/viewer/engineservlet?
__uri=<i>{Report Path}</i>%5Ctest.rptdesign
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">Build S20050314 Note</span>: 
The viewer currently 
requires an absolute path to the report on the server machine. Upcoming versions 
will support relative paths.</p>

<p class="caution">
<span class="caution-head">Build S20050314 Note</span>: 
The above link will run the report with default parameter values. The link
to display the parameter page is not yet available in this build.</p>

<p>The report should run and appear in your browser.
