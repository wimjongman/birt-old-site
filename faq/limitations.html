<h1>Browser Limitations</h1>
<p>
BIRT follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">W3C CSS 2.1</a> standards. However,
Microsoft IE follows a subset
of these standards. The following table shows the limitations within BIRT due
to limitations of browser and of
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a>.

<h1>Eclipse 3.1</h1>

<h2>Q: Does BIRT support Eclipse 3.1?</h2>
<p>
Not yet. Some users have said that they've gotten it to work with the 3.1
milestone or preview builds, but the BIRT team does not yet test with
Eclipse 3.1. If you try BIRT on Eclipse 3.1, and find problems, please report 
them via <a href="../community.html">Bugzilla</a> so the team can fix them.</p>

<h1>App Servers</h1>

<h2>Q: What versions of Tomcat does BIRT support?</h2>

<p>BIRT is certified with Tomcat 4.1.30. BIRT is not certified, and 
known problems exist, with the Tomcat 5.0 and 5.5 releases, though these will be 
fixed before BIRT 1.0 ships.</p>

<h1>General</h1>

<h2>Q: Does BIRT keep its data set in memory?</h2>
<p>
Release 1.0 produces reports on demand, and keeps the entire report
(including the data set) in memory. Because reports are on demand, and delivered
as a single HTML page, reports in Release 1 will be small.
<br><br>
Later releases will store reports
on disk, and will support reports of unlimited size. At that time,
the data set will also be written to disk when it becomes too large
for memory.</p>

<h2>Q: Does BIRT support crosstabs?</h2>
<p>
This is planned for a future release.
</p>

<h2>Q: Does BIRT support Java 5 (AKA Java 1.5)?</h2>
<p>
Not yet. Some users have build BIRT under this version of Java and have
reported minor compile problems. The BIRT team does not yet test with
Java 5.
