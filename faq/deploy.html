<p class="subhead">Deploying BIRT</p>

<h1>Deployment</h1>

<div class="q">How do I install the BIRT Report Engine in my app server?</div>
<div class="ans">
The ERE is a series of Java class files that can be deployed in any 
Java/J2EE environment &ndash; this could be within a server based application, or 
a client-side application. The ERE is the runtime component of BIRT &ndash; when 
you call it in the context of your application, you pass it a report design. 
The ERE then will access the data source, retrieve the data, do the required 
agregations/sorting, etc., and then format the report for presentation as 
HTML or PDF, for example.
<br><br>
The BIRT report viewer is included with the report designer and is used to preview
reports. It doubles as an example of how to integrate the Report Engine into a
J2EE application.

<div class="q">Can I use BIRT within a Rich Client Application (RCP)?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD</div>

<div class="q">How do I manage reports within my application? Storage? Security?</div>
<div class="ans"></div>

<div class="q">Can I store report designs in a location other than the file system?</div>
<div class="ans">
Not at present, but we are looking into possible changes to support this.
Also, Eclipse itself may be looking into this.
</div>

<div class="q">Do BIRT reports need to be compiled before they are run?</div>
<div class="ans">
No, there is no compile step. The BIRT Report Engine directly executes the report 
design XML file. (This is one reason that BIRT uses interpreted JavaScript instead
of compiled Java as its scripting language.)</div>

<div class="q">Can BIRT reports be saved on disk?</div>
<div class="ans">
Reports in release 1 are run on demand, then discarded. A BIRT report run
creates the report, converts it to HTML or PDF, then discards the report. A later
release will add the ability to save the <i>report document</i> on disk.
