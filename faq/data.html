<p class="head">BIRT FAQ</p>
<p class="subhead">Data Access</p>

<h1>General</h1>

<div class="q">What is a "data aource" and "data set"?</div>
<div class="ans">
BIRT uses these two terms to define how the report accesses data.
<br><br>
<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Data Set
<dd>is a description of data to be retrieved. SQL queries are the 
ones most often used, but BIRT also supports a wide variety of sources such 
as stored procedures, Java classes and so on.

<dt>Data Source
<dd>is a connection to an external system, such as a JDBC 
connection. Data sources are optional, some data sets, such as XML or CSV 
files, don't need a connection.
</dl>
<br>
Any one BIRT report can contain any number of data sets and 
data sources.
</div>

<div class="q">Can I build my own data set?</div>
<div class="ans">
Yes. The only requirement is that your data set return data in tabular 
format so that BIRT can perform sorting, aggregation, grouping and so on.
There are two ways to build a data set:
<br><br>
<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Scripted data set
<dd>Best for data sets that are used by one specific report. (For example, to
access a specific set of application objects.) 

<dt>Extended data set
<dd>Created using BIRT's Open Data Access (ODA) framework. Extended data sets
are best when creating a generic feature used access a type of data source. (For
example, to access web logs.)
</dl>
</div>

<h1>Supported Data Sources</h1>

<div class="q">What data sources does BIRT support?</div>
<div class="ans">BIRT Release 1 supports two data sources:
<br><br>
<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>JDBC
<dd>Works with any JDBC driver. 

<dt>Scripted
<dd>Lets you write code to access other data sources. 
</dl>
</div>

<div class="q">How do I add my JDBC driver to BIRT?</div>
<div class="ans">See the
<a href="../build/install.html">installation instructions</a>.
</div>

<h1>Scripted Data Sources</h1>

<div class="q">How do I get data from a POJO (Plain Old Java Object)?</div>
<div class="ans">
This can be done using the scripted data set element. Let's take an example: 
exposing an org chart as a data set. Let's assume that the org chart is 
represented by a tree, and that the report wants to present this data in the 
form of, say, a phone list. We'll need to write some "glue" code to link the
POJO to BIRT.
<br><br>
Next, we need to identify the right element within the design to hold 
the glue code. In this case, since we're creating a data set, we'd choose 
a "scripted data set."
<br><br>
Then, we work out exactly what the glue code needs to do. The scripted data 
set has three methods: <code>open</code>, <code>fetch</code> and 
<code>close</code>. Let's suppose that the <code>open</code> 
method will get a handle to our org chart, perhaps by calling a factory 
method exposed in Java. JavaScript has an import statement that creates a 
bridge to our Java objects. So, we'd import, say, the factory class and the 
"org chart node" class. In <code>open</code>  we might say something like the 
following:

<pre class="code-block">
// Import your package.

importPackage( com.company.YourApp );

// Get an instance of the chart node.

var theChart = OrgChartFactory.getChart( );

// The variable iter becomes a property of the data set
// instance object.

iter = theChart.iterator( );
</pre>
Then, in the fetch method, we'd need to create a row for each org chart 
node:

<pre class="code-block">
// This variable becomes a property of the data set 

instance object;

// Done?

if ( ! iter.hasNext( ) ) { return null; }

// Turn the node into a data row

var node = iter.next( );
var row = newDataRow( );
row.name = node.getName( );
row.deptNo = node.getDeptNo( );
row.title = node.getTitle( );
row.phone = node.getPhoneNo( );
return row;
</pre>

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M1 Note:</span>
The above code samples are preliminary; the scripted data set is not yet
available, and so its implemetation is subject to change.</div>
<br>
It is necessary to copy the data into a data row so that the Report Engine 
can resort it. In our case, the iterator may return the data using a 
depth-first traversal, but we want it sorted by name to create a phone list. 
You could also create the data row in Java if you prefer.
<br><br>
There is some other boilerplate needed to declare the row schema, but the 
above illustrates the key point about calling into Java.
</div>

<div class="q">How do I get data from a Java Bean?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD.</div>

<div class="q">How do I use XML as a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD.</div>

<div class="q">How do I use Web Services as a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD.</div>

<div class="q">How do I use web server logs as a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">
TBD. The BIRT project is working with the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools">Web Tools Project</a> (WTP)
to create reports from web logs, but the work is very much at an early stage.
</div>

<div class="q">How do I use popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools such as
Hibernate and JDO as a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">
JDO (Java Data Objects) is used to connect to any source (relational or non-relational)
while Hibernate is used to connect to relational databases.
<br><br>
TBD. You can access the objects as is described for POJOs above.
</div>

<div class="q">My class implements java.sql.ResultSet. How do I use it as
a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">
TBD. You can access the objects as is described for POJOs above.
</div>

<h1>Application Integration</h1>

<div class="q">How can I pass a connection object to BIRT?</div>
<div class="ans">
Not at present. We're looking into how to achieve this in future release.
</div>

<div class="q">How can I secure the user name and password used to connect
to a data source?</div>
<div class="ans">
The designer prompts you to enter the server name, user name and password when
building a JDBC data source. While this works for testing, production systems will
often externalize this information from the report design so that the same design
can work against both a test and production database, or against different production
databases.
<br><br>
BIRT provides a <i>configuration variable</i> feature that lets you bind named
values to values set outside of the report design. The details of this feature are
still under discussion.
</div>

<div class="q">My customers generally don't know SQL, XML, database schemas etc.
They just know the domain specific terms. Can I create a custom data source and
custom data set designer?</div>
<div class="ans">
Yes, BIRT provides excellent extension features via ODA as described above. 
You can provide both 
the run-time mechanism to access the data, as well as the design-time UI for 
defining your data set.
<br><br>
If your users are comforatable using a tool such as Eclipse, then they can 
use your custom UI to build reports within the BIRT designer. If, however, 
your users want a very simple tool, you can provide your own designer that 
asks the right questions, then generates the report for them, filling in all 
the "boiler plate", perhaps using one of several standard layouts defined by 
your app. This reflects the "embedded" nature of BIRT.
</div>

<div class="q">How can I access application-specific metadata to simplify
report design?</div>
<div class="ans">
Some applications want to integrate BIRT into their application so that BIRT
has access to the Business Process Model (BPM) (or other metadata)
for the application's data objects and their schemas. This avoids having
the report designer duplicate the efforts of the BPM designer.
The result allow the report design tool to have Business Process Intelligence
built-in.
<br><br>
While Release 1 of BIRT won't 
provide such integration out-of-the-box, others can certainly build on top 
of BIRT to provide it. To see how, let's divide reporting into two steps: 
design and execution. The design step is the one where BPM integration would 
likely occur.
<br><br>
A BIRT design is an XML file that contains instructions for accessing a data 
source, transforming the data (sorting, filtering, totals), and presenting 
the results. An integrated application needs the ability to build a 
query based on the BPM. Once the report developer has that data, he'd use 
BIRT's features for identifying totals and formatting the results. The 
result of this process would be a BIRT XML design file that the BIRT Report 
Engine executes to produce your final report.
<br><br>
There are two ways that you can integrate BIRT with the BPM system at 
design time.
<br><br>
First, you can develop a custom data set builder extension to the BIRT 
designer. The builder could 
leverage the meta-data information in the BPM. The custom builder would be 
integrated with BIRT using the extension features of Eclipse. The 
result would be a custom data set that looks to BIRT just like any other 
data set.
<br><br>
Suppose that the BPM system identifies that there is a Customer concept, and 
that Orders are related to Customers. Suppose further that the BPM system 
can provide descriptive information about customers, and about the fields 
for a customer. A custom data set builder could display this information to 
help the user understand the data, and use the relationships to help the 
user choose the data of interest. The details, of course, are likely to 
depend on the specific BPM system in question.
<br><br>
Second, you can develop a custom report designer that is tightly integrated 
with the BPM system. Suppose that the system provides sufficient information 
to generate a wide range of reports. Suppose further that the application 
requires only a small set of formats, so that designs could be created 
automatically. In this case, you can write an application that generates 
BIRT designs directly from the BPM system. You can then directly execute 
those designs in the BIRT report engine, or load them into the BIRT designer 
for further refinement.
<br><br>
In either case, you'd leverage one of BIRT's key goals: the ability for 
others to add application-specific functionality to BIRT.
</div>

<h1>Extended Data Sets</h1>

<div class="q">How can I create a custom extended data set?</div>
<div class="ans">
BIRT provides an Open Data Access (ODA) extension framework.
ODA provides extension points to allow anyone to add a custom <i>data
access driver</i>. See the ROM Data Specification for details.
<br><br>
BIRT ODA extension defines a set of public interfaces.  It adopts the Eclipse
plug-in framework to provide a designer tool, and a runtime driver for
data retrieval during report generation.
<br><br>
In short, a custom data source implements
the BIRT runtime data access interfaces.  This interface is similar to JDBC,
and it supports additional capabilities such as any types of data source, the
use of data source specific query text ( i.e. not SQL specific), complex
parameters, etc.
A ResultSet-like interface with a next method implements an iterator,
which your implementation could control and optimize the data generation or
retrieval.
<br><br>
At design time, the Eclipse plug-in for BIRT data extension allows you to provide a
designer GUI tool specific to an external data source.  The plug-in designer tool
then uses the BIRT public API to specify the data set and data source
definitions. The custom data source and data set information is saved
in the report design file. The BIRT Data Engine
passes the data definition to the
extension's ODA runtime driver. The driver can use this information
for query execution. ODA then uses the result set API to retrieve results.
<br><br>
The ODA runtime interfaces are JDBC-like, but have been extended to support
additional capabilities of non-RDBMS data sources.  An ODA driver basically
implements the public runtime interfaces. This implementation wraps
the data source specific APIs (such as web services, etc.) to retrieve data rows.
<br><br>
For a preview, the ODA runtime interfaces source are available in the
<a href="../build">Eclipse BIRT CVS</a>
source code repository, in the org.eclipse.birt.data.oda package under the
org.eclipse.birt.data subproject.
<br><br>
The JDBC implementation is available as a sample. It is in the Eclipse
CVS under the org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc and ...oda.jdbc.ui
subprojects.
</div>

<div class="q">Is odaconfig.xml documented anywhere?</div>
<div class="ans">
ODA and its configuration files are documented in 
the JavaDoc for ODA itself. It is in:
<br>
source/org.eclipse.birt.data/src/org/eclipse/birt/data/oda
<br><br>
A copy of the ODA configuration's XML schema definition (ODAConfig.xsd) and
related annotations can be found in BIRT's Eclipse CVS, under the
source/org.eclipse.birt.data/schema folder.
The JDBC ODA driver's odaconfig.xml is a fairly good example of the main
configurable options.
