<h2>Q: Can I extend BIRT?</h2>
<p>
Yes, BIRT provides several extension points:
<ul>
<li>Data access extensions through BIRT's Open Data Access (ODA) framework.
<li>Extended data access UI using the Eclipse plugin framework.<li>Extended report items that add visual items such as gauges, etc. 
Includes design-time UI support.<li>Scripting within a report. Scripting can access application-specific
business logic implemented as Java classes.
<li>Rendering extensions that produce additional report output formats. 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Q: How can I create a custom report item such as a stop light?</h2>
<p>
How Java developers could extend the basic BIRT model through the
creation of Java objects that are accessed through BIRT script.  For
instance, a company would like to develop a propietary Stop Light Display
for use in a management summary report, this display would have a
significant amount of business logic and display logic that they would like
to implement in Java.
<br><br>
ROM calls this an "extended item". The development team is working on a 
specification of exactly how this will happen. Briefly, you start by 
creating an extension definition file, something like that created for 
plug-ins in Eclipse. In that file you identify the element name, the 
properties, and the Java classes to use in the Designer, Report Engine. The 
Designer class paints the design-time view of the element using SWT (or can 
just return an image.)
<br><br>
The Report Engine has two phases: the Factory (which creates the report) and 
the Presentation phase which renders the report to HTML, FO, PDF, etc. The 
extension file provides separate classes for each phase. The Factory class 
is often optional; even without it the Factory can figure out (from the 
property definitions) what data needs to be stored in the report document.
<br><br>
The Presentation class does the bulk of the work. Let's take the simplest 
case where the element can be represented by an image. Your stop light 
example fits this well. In this case, the Presentation Java class gets two 
pieces of information: the element design (or definition) and the element 
instance. The element design holds all the properties the user set in the 
designer. Perhaps here that includes the color settings, the threshold for 
which light to show, etc.  The element instance provides the data. Suppose 
that the stoplight shows actual sales as a percent of quota. If so, we can 
get this percent from the element instance. We then compare this with the 
design setting for the threshold, and determine say, that the ratio is 90%, 
and so we should show the yellow light.
<br><br>
We then create an image and return it to the Report Engine, which "does the 
right thing" to put the image into the HTML file, PDF or whatever.
<br><br>
Notice that, in this second case, no JavaScript is needed. Adding an 
extended item is something that a skilled Java developer would do. Once 
installed in BIRT, it would be automatically available to all reports as 
just a BIRT-defined report item.
<br><br>
That's the high level answer. Please take a look at the extension 
specification once it is released and see if it provides the details you'd 
need to create such an extension.
