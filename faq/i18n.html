<h1>Internationalization</h1>

<h2>Q: Do BIRT reports support localization (L10N) and internationalization
(I18N)?</h2>
<p>Yes. Do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a standard Java properties file within your report project.</li>
  <li>Create properties for each resource you want to localize.</li>
  <li>Set the Resources property of your report. Select the white space in the 
  layout editor. Open the Property Editor. Switch to the General tab. Enter your 
  property file name in the Resources field.</li>
  <li>For each label, go the &quot;Localization&quot; tab in the Property Editor and 
  choose the appropriate resource from the list for the Content key property.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run your report, BIRT will use the standard Java system for locating 
a property file that matches the user's locale. The resources for that file will 
appear in your labels. (If BIRT cannot find a resource file, or cannot find the 
requested key, then the default text for the label will appear. The default text 
is what you entered in BIRT's layout editor.)</p>

<h2>Q: Can different bits of a report appear in different locales?</h2>
<p>
For example, suppose BIRT is used in an ERP application. Invoices are printed 
in the locale of the customer. The user wants
to see the invoice in the same locale as the customer. For example, if the
user's locale is German, but customer's local is American, then the user would
see the invoice in American format with English strings, decimal point "." instead of
German "," etc.
<br><br>
This feature is not available in Release 1.0. It is something to consider for
a future release.
</p>

<h2>Q: Can the user specify the report locale when running the report?</h2>
<p>Reports are viewed using the <a href="../deploy/viewer-use.html">BIRT web 
application</a>. This application takes a __locale parameter within the URL for 
running a report. Simply set this parameter to the desired locale.</p>
