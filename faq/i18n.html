<h1>Internationalization</h1>

<div class="q">Do BIRT reports support localization (L10N) and internationalization
(I18N)?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD</div>

<div class="q">How can the user choose a locale different than his own?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD</div>

<div class="q">Can different bits of a report appear in different locales?</div>
<div class="ans">
For example, suppose BIRT is used in an ERP application. Invoices are printed 
in the locale of the customer. The user wants
to see the invoice in the same locale as the customer. For example, if the
user's locale is German, but customer's local is American, then the user would
see the invoice in American format with english strings, decimal point "." instead of
German "," etc.
<br><br>
This feature is not available in Release 1.0. It is something to consider for
a future release.

<div class="q">Can the user specify the report locale when running the report?</div>
<div class="ans">TBD</div>
