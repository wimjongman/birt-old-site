<h1>Report Object Model (ROM)</h1>

<p class="q">What is the ROM?</p>

<font SIZE="2">
<p class="ans">ROM stands for &quot;Report Object Model.&quot; It is the model (or 
specification) behind BIRT report elements. Just as HTML, CSS and SOAP are 
standards separate from an implementation, so ROM is a model separate from the 
BIRT implementation.</p>
<p class="ans">ROM is the model behind the palette items, property dialogs, 
methods and so on. ROM consists of a set of core elements, and rules for adding 
extended elements.</p>
<p class="ans">Elements can have properties. Properties have a type. Property 
types include simple ones such a string, number, dimension and so or. Property 
types also include complex ones such as structures, lists, and lists of 
structures. For example, static text is defined as a structure with text and a 
resource key for internationalization.</p>
<p class="ans">Elements can fit together using &quot;slots&quot;. Each element has named 
slots. For example, the report element has slots for the layout (body), for 
styles, and so on.</p>
<p class="ans">Elements can have methods &amp; expressions (code). These are 
specialized forms of properties.</p>
<p class="ans">In a later release, elements will be able to inherit from another 
element. This will allow reuse. For example, you can define a data source in a 
library, and use it in multiple report designs.</p>
<p class="ans">ROM provides styles and style properties. ROM's style system is 
based on CSS, extended for use within a report. Users can create their own 
styles, or can use many predefined styles. Predefined styles in ROM select 
specific report items. For example, the &quot;report&quot; style sets defaults for the 
entire report. As in CSS, styles cascade. Style information set on a container 
element cascades to its contents.</p>
<p class="ans">To learn more about ROM, read the ROM Specifications located in 
the <a href="../ref">reference area</a> of this web site.</p>

<p class="q">What is the XML design file?</p>
<p class="ans">BIRT stores your report design in a &quot;design file.&quot; This file is 
in XML format and has a &quot;.rptdesign&quot; suffix. The XML design file is created by 
the BIRT designer and directly executed by the BIRT engine; there is no 
compilation step.</p>
<p class="q">What is the ROM schema?</p>
<div class="ans">
<p>The BIRT XML design file is defined by an XML schema. At present, 
the schema is located in the BIRT source code in the 
org.eclipse.birt.report.model project in the src\org\eclipse\birt\report\model\parser\design.xsd 
file. Eventually, it will move to a well-defined location on the Eclipse web 
site.</p>
<p>The schema is designed to allow extensions. The schema defines 
syntax that allows extensions to be added to BIRT without making changes to the 
actual schema. For example, an extended item uses the following tag:</p>
<pre class="code-block">&lt;extended-item name=&quot;extension&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>Properties are in a generic form:</p>
<pre class="code-block">&lt;property name=&quot;propName&quot;&gt;value&lt;/property&gt;.</p>
<p>In this sense, the schema describes a syntax for representing 
report elements in general. The schema does not list the properties, for 
example; that is defined in a separate rom.def file that is derived from the ROM 
specification.</p>
</div>
<p class="q">What is rom.def?</p>
<p class="ans">The ROM schema defines the syntax for the XML design file. The specific set of ROM-defined elements, their slots, and their properties are defined by a separate metadata file called rom.def. This file is in the BIRT source code in the org.eclipse.birt.report.model in the src\org\eclipse\birt\report\model\elements\rom.def file.</p>

<p class="ans">Rom.def contains the information that drives the generic property sheet by defining properties and property types. It also describes JavaScript objects defined by BIRT and other meta-data.</p>

<p class="ans">The metadata subsystem of the BIRT model provides a Java API to access this information.s</p>

<h1>Page Number</h1>

<p class="q">How do I display page numbers in HTML or PDF?</p>
<p class="ans">BIRT uses Apache FOP to convert a report to PDF. FOP does 
pagination and assigns page numbers. As a result, there is no JavaScript 
expression you can use to get the current page number. Instead, BIRT will add a 
new &quot;page number&quot; element. It will include a special marker string that tells 
BIRT or FO where to insert the page number. BIRT will interpret the string when 
converting to HTML, and will convert the marker to the required FO syntax when 
converting to PDF using FOP.<br>
<div class="ans">
The element will allow you to say something like:
<pre class="code-block">Page $page of $count</pre>
At runtime, this will be replaced by:
<pre class="code-block">Page 1 of 5</pre><br>

<div class="caution"><span class="caution-head">Release 1.0M2 Note:</span> The 
  page number element has not yet been released. Syntax is still subject to 
  change.</div>
