<h1>Output Formats</h1>

<div class="q">What report output formats does BIRT support?</div>
<div class="ans">
Release 1.0 supports HTML output as a single HTML page. It also supports
paginated output using XML-FO via the Apache FOP project.
</div>

<h1>Unix Printing</h1>

<div class="q">Does BIRT support printing on UNIX on non-postscript printers?</div>
<div class="ans">
The first release of BIRT will only support printing in PDF format. 
However, postscript printing on Unix could be added in the future. 
<br><br>
Our current thought is that almost all major printers support postscript 
or PDF. Even if a printer is claimed to be a PCL printer, the vendor often 
provides a downloadable postscript driver file. If a postscript printing 
system is to be implemented for BIRT, the postscript file will likely be 
generated in the following way:

<ol>
<li>The printer driver is parsed and 
printer specific commands (i.e., printer escapes) are generated for 
printer-specific features, such as collation, paper tray, landscape vs. 
portrait, etc.
<li>Report contents, which are usually drawn in a 
printer-independent way, are generated as printer-independent postscript.
</ol>
BIRT is designed to allow seamless extensions. So your formatting and 
protocol modules can be designed as plugins. 
</div>

<h1>PDF Output</h1>

<div class="q">BIRT uses XML-FO for output. Apache FOP has known performance
and feature limitations. How does BIRT address these issues?</div>
<div class="ans">
A user reported that he'd taken a look at Apache's FOP.  The performance 
was poor for a reasonable sized document.  Also, there 
were concerns about the memory usage while processing these documents 
and whether that would lead to any scalability problems during rendering.
<br><br>
Using FOP for the first release allows us to 
focus on other areas of report generation and rendering. At the same time, 
performance is a key goal. We're running tests to get a good sense of the 
actual issues. XSL:FO is a convenient way to handle conversion and be 
standards-compliant -- if it works. As a result, we intend to generate FO 
that follows CSS standard. However, since FOP does not support many 
features for now, we also allow generation FO that contains some 
workarounds so that the FOP output makes more sense. 
<br><br>
The Engine is designed to allow extended converters, so we/others can plug 
in a better converter easily if/when needed.
<br><br>
In the first release, reports are on demand and in a single web page, so 
are expected to be small. In a subsequent release, reports will be stored 
on disk and can be any size. That will be an excellent time to determine 
if we need to reconsider our conversion strategy. One approach is to 
directly go from report design to PDF, as someone already suggested in the 
newsgroup.

<h1>Non-Latin Characters</h1>

<div class="q">I've used Chinese characters in my design, but they don't appear in
PDF. What do I do?</div>
<div class="ans">
BIRT uses
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> to generate PDF output, 
so you can consult with FOP 
documents for using Chinese characters. Using Chinese characters in FOP 
needs some customization, such as:

<ul>
<li>Create a font metrix file for the font types you used
<li>Define the font used by FOP
<li>Embedded the font into PDF
</ul>

Font configurations are described in FOP FAQ, 
<ul>
<li>http://xml.apache.org/fop/faq.html#pdf-characters-menu
<li>http://xml.apache.org/fop/fonts.html
<li>http://xml.apache.org/fop/configuration.html
</ul>
We might integrate FOP configurations into BIRT configuration. But before 
that is done, you may have to customize FOP by yourself.
