<p class="subhead">Project Issues</p>

<h1>Release Schedule</h1>

<h2>Q: What is the BIRT release schedule?</div> </h2>
<p>
BIRT will release a stable build every two weeks between now and the 1.0
release. BIRT will release a milestone build one a month between now and
1.0. This means that stable and milestone builds will alternate.
Release plans after 1.0 are not yet defined.</div>

<h1>Project Source</h1>

<h2>Q: Where can I find the BIRT project source?</div> </h2>
<p>
BIRT source is in the Eclipse CVS system. Full information for obtaining
and building the source is available on the
<a href="../build">BIRT Build page</a>.
</div>

<h2>Q: I'm behind a firewall and cannot access CVS. Is there another
way to access the source?</div> </h2>
<p>
Eclipse provides an
<a href="<a href="../frameizer.php?page=http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/">
HTML interface</a> into CVS. Be sure to select the
<a href="../frameizer.php?page=http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/?cvsroot=BIRT_Project">
BIRT Project</a> to see the BIRT sources.</div>

<h2>Q: How do I build BIRT?</div> </h2>
<p>
Complete instructions are available on the
<a href="../build/build_instr.html">Build page</a>.
</div>

<h1>Contribution</h1>

<h2>Q: How can I contribute to the BIRT Project?</div> </h2>
<p>BIRT is an open source project and seeks contributions in many areas:

<dl class="arrow-list">
<dt>Answer questions in the newsgroup.</dt>
<dd>As BIRT grows, new people will come to BIRT and ask questions that more
experienced users have already answered. A great way to "give back" to the
BIRT community is to answer such questions.</dd>

<dt>Try out new builds &amp; features and report suggestions &amp; problems.</dt>
<dd>BIRT uses an incremental development process: "release early and often." If
you're adventerous, try out new builds &amp; features and let us know about bugs,
or ways to improve the product.</dd>

<dt>Platform, driver, app server and other integration issues.</dt>
<dd>The team tests BIRT on a set of plaforms identified in the
<a href="../project/project_plan_R1_0.html">Project Plan</a>. If you work on a
different platform, please try BIRT and report any problems that you find. File
bugs using Bugzilla. Please be as specific as possible, since the development team
does not have access to your platform.</dd>

<dt>Examples.</dt>
<dd>Examples help users quickly see what BIRT can do, show how to accomplish tasks,
and help the development team visualize how BIRT is used in practice. You can contribute
a static example (HTML output of a report), a report design, a code example and
more. Eventually, we'll have a place to submit such examples. For now, please
let us know on the newsgroup that you've got an example and we'll work with you
to get it onto the web site.</dd>

<dt>Articles.</dt>
<dd>Articles can include how-to, tutorials, case studies, or brief notes about how
to solve a particular problem, integrate with a particular bit of sofware and so on.
Again, we'll eventually have a place to submit such articles, but for now please
let us know via the newsgroup.</dd>

<dt>Bug fixes.</dt>
<dd>If you discover a problem or enhancement, and have the time &amp; skills to
track down the problem and find a fix; you can submit the fix to the development
team as a Bugzilla entry.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<h2>Q: How can I contribute code to the BIRT Project?</div> </h2>
<p>Eclipse has an extensive process for code contributions. (LINK) Briefly, start
by completing the (NAME) form required for all code submitters. Then, follow
the (STUFF) development process to first submit bugs &amp; patches via Bugzilla.</div>

<h2>Q: I'd like to help develop BIRT. How do I do that?</div> </h2>
<p>Start with the above process.
Eventually, if you're level of participation remains high, and your code is of
good quality, the development team can vote to make you a committer.
All Eclipse Foundation projects must follow the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse%20Development%20Process%202003_11_09%20FINAL.pdf">
Eclipse Development Process</a>.
<p>
In brief, you have to earn the right to be contributor. On other projects, this was
done by submitting code patches, bug fixes, etc. (See above) On the Web Tools
project (WTP), there are people that have a related open source project or plug-in and 
have donated it to the WTP  project and became contributor this way.</div>

<h1>Futures</h1>

<h2>Q: What other projects might fit within the BIRT project?</div> </h2>
<p>BIRT has chosen to focus on embedded reporting for the first release. Other possible
projects could expand BIRT into many of the dimensions of Business
Intelligence:

<ul>
<li>Data Modeling tools for defining schemas, meta data.

<li>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools for creating and maintaining the data
warehouse.

<li>Developer-oriented reporting tools for embedded reporting from operational
and data warehouse stores within the application.

<li>Business-user query tools for providing users with flexible ad hoc access
to that data.

<li>Analysis tools that enable power-users to slice-and-dice the same data.
</ul></div>

<h2>Q: How does the BIRT project relate to TPTP, Data Tools, etc.</div> </h2>
<p>Eclipse is an active, growing community with new top-level projects being
created at a lively pace. The BIRT PMC has an active dialog with these other
projects to figure out where BIRT can leverage existing or proposed
functionality. With a community as dynamic as Eclipse, we'll adjust our plans
as the community evolves.</div>
