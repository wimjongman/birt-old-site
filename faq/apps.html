<h1>Authorization</h1>

<h2>Q: How does one
assign access/viewing rights to specific sets of data?</h2>

<p>
For example: User A is a member of the HR department. Users in the HR Department are
allowed to see all employees, and their details, but not any of the salary
information. User B is a manager of the development department. User B is
permitted to see salary information for all users that work for her, but is
not permitted to see salary information for her bosses or anyone in another
department and can't see HIPAA information under any circumstances.
Both receive a link to the report to view, and each sees different
information.
<p>
BIRT provides several features to support such a security model.
The first step is to define your security key. BIRT is designed to be  part 
of a J2EE server. Let's suppose that your J2EE session  provides a user ID 
and security group. You'd access these in BIRT  through scripting. (We're 
working out the exact details of how  scripting will gain access to the J2EE 
session.) Let's call these userID and groupID.
<p>
Next, we have to implement the actual security. There are a number of 
choices.

<ul class="arrow-list">
<li>
The easiest is run-time row-level security. Use the userID or  groupID to 
parameterize your WHERE clause. The report would only  show those rows to 
which the user has access.
<li>
The next case is column-level security: hide certain columns from  certain 
users. This is the kind of security in your use case.
</ul>

<p>There are two ways to implement column security: run time or view time.
<ul class="arrow-list">
<li>
Run-time security works well for on-demand reports, or  reports that only 
one user will see. We control the data that goes  into the report, then we 
show that data at view time.
<li>
View-time security let's us create one report shared by all users, then 
tailor the display depending on who is viewing the report.
</ul>
Let's tackle run-time security. BIRT supports the idea of a computed column. 
The value of the column can be computed using any arbitrary JavaScript 
expression. We create a computed column whose  value is either the column 
you want to show (if the userID or groupID matches some attribute of the 
row) or null if the user does not have permission. Null values will appear 
blank in the report.
<p>
For the salary, suppose that each employee is assigned to a department 
(deptID) and the user session identifies the department (if any) that the 
user manages: mgrDept. Your computed column contains the salary if deptID == 
mgrDept, and null otherwise.
<p>
To implement view-time security, associate the security with the report item 
that shows the column. In your use case, associate the data item with the 
report item that shows the salary column.  BIRT has a visibility expression 
that determines when the item should appear. Use the user information to 
determine whether the salary report item should be visible or not for any 
given user.
<p>
Release 1 supports only on-demand reports: the person who runs the report is 
the only person who can view the report. Hence, both  run-time and view-time 
security produce the same visual result. Later, when reports can be stored, 
the difference between run-time and view-time security will  be critical.
<p>
You can expand these techniques for other kinds of customization.  You can 
include entire subreports based on the run-time user. For example, a boss 
gets a salary history for each employee in his  department, but not for 
employees in other departments.
<p>
And, these techniques work for non-security cases. For example, perhaps you 
have a bug report that has options for "summary",  "normal" and "detailed". 
The user sets a report parameter with one  of these choices. Based on this 
parameter, your bug report shows different kinds of information. If summary, 
only bug numbers & titles appear. If normal, then, say, bug number, title, 
description, owner and status appear. If detailed, then the report  also 
includes comments, change history, and so on.
<p>
If you really want to go wild, you can even completely customize the report 
before it runs. You can implement a method that will  rewrite the XML file. 
For example, the bug report above could  provide lots of parameters for 
"include owner?", "include history?",  "include comments?", "layout type" 
and so on. Based on this, you can generate a new XML design file on-the-fly 
for a customized report. This  is the file that the Engine will run. Sounds 
complicated, but it can be a handy way to implement a highly customizable 
report.
